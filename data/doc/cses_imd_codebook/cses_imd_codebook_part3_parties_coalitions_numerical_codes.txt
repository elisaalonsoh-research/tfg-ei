))) IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING PHASE 3 RELEASE OF THE CSES INTEGRATED 
    MODULE DATASET (IMD)
===========================================================================

This dataset and all accompanying documentation comprises the Phase 3 
Release of the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD). 

The CSES Integrated Module Dataset is being released in a phased way. Thus, 
this release is an advance version of the dataset, and thus lacks some of
the checking, documentation, and inclusion of certain variables that are 
expected with the Full Release of this dataset. 

This Phase 3 Release is provided as a service to the CSES user community,
for those analysts who find it valuable to work with preliminary versions
of the dataset. We would appreciate being notified of any errors in the
dataset or documentation by email to "cses@umich.edu".

Users should expect future changes and improvements to the data and 
documentation of variables. If users wish to re-use their programming code 
on a future release of the file, the code should be written in a way that 
is flexible and can be accommodating of these future changes.

Users of the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD) may wish to monitor the 
errata for CSES IMD on the CSES website, to check for known errors which 
may impact their analyses. To view errata for CSES IMD Phase 3, go to 
Data Download on the CSES website, navigate to the CSES IMD download page, 
and click on the Errata link in the white box to the right of the page.

Users of the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD) are also advised that 
while the CSES IMD Codebook is comprehensive, users are strongly advised
to consult Standalone CSES Module Documentation including Standalone CSES  
Module Codebooks, Macro Reports, Design Reports, and Election Summaries.


===========================================================================
))) OVERVIEW OF "CODEBOOK PART 3: PARTIES/COALITIONS, HARMONIZED NUMERICAL
    CODES"
===========================================================================

Part 3 of the CSES IMD Codebook identifies and details the harmonized 
NUMERICAL Coding Schemes used in CSES IMD to refer to the parties/coalitions 
participating in a polity's national elections or previous elections. 

The numerical codes assigned to each party/coalition, which are harmonized
and consistent across all modules and elections in the dataset, are listed 
for each country. 


===========================================================================
))) HOW TO NAVIGATE THE CSES IMD CODEBOOK
===========================================================================

CSES IMD Codebook is produced in .txt format to allow for easy accessibility 
and as such, the Codebook can be read into a variety of programs. 
 
The CSES IMD Codebook can be navigated quickly in the electronic files, with
the following commands allowing for quick searching:
 
)))  = Section Header 

>>>  = Sub-section Header 1

<<>> = Sub-section Header 2

+++  = Tables

VARIABLES NOTES = Notes for particular variables. 

POLITY NOTES = Notes for a particular polity.

[POLITY NOTES] = Notes for a particular polity where data in CSES IMD
deviates from published data in Standalone CSES Modules.

ELECTION STUDY NOTES = Notes for a particular election study.  

[ELECTION STUDY NOTES] = Notes for a particular election study where data
in CSES IMD deviates from published data in Standalone CSES Modules.

POTENTIAL PARTY/COALITION LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable 
that may be used for data bridging at party/coalition level.


===========================================================================
))) CSES CODEBOOK - POLITY NOTES AND ELECTION STUDY NOTES
===========================================================================

A unique dimension of the CSES are the inclusion of POLITY NOTES and
ELECTION STUDY NOTES. They are notes which are attached to each 
variable included in the dataset and refer to case-specific 
information regarding a particular variable. This information
may apply to a polity consistently in the dataset (i.e.: a POLITY NOTE)
or one election study in the dataset (i.e.: an ELECTION STUDY NOTE). 
Their purpose is to provide users with more detailed information on the 
case or explain essential deviations specific to cases from CSES 
conventions. 

They can be navigated in the Codebook by searching for "POLITY NOTES" or
"ELECTION STUDY NOTES" in Parts 2-5 of the CSES IMD Codebook.

>>> CSES CODING OF PARTY/COALITIONS AND LEADERS IN CSES IMD - A NEW 
    DEPARTURE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> CSES IMD NUMERICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING - HARMONIZATION

CSES IMD marks a radical new departure in the CSES approach to the coding
of  parties and coalitions. All parties/coalitions or presidential
candidates, where applicable, participating in the election or the previous
election receive a NUMERICAL code. These codes are used to identify the
following: 

   - who the respondent voted for in the current election (IMD3002). 
   - who the respondent voted for in the previous election (IMD3004).
   - the respondent's party identification (IMD3005_3).

In CSES IMD, each party/coalition receives a unique numerical identifier 
that is consistent across modules. This seven-digit numerical identifier 
contains information on the polity and a unique numerical value to 
distinguish the party/coalition. Hence, numerical party/coalition codes 
are harmonized across Modules within CSES IMD. 

The first three digits of the identifier consist of the three-digit UN 
Polity Identifier Code. The remaining four digits consist of numerical 
codes ranging from 0001 to 9999, with each party/coalition assigned a value 
that remains consistent across Modules.   
In assigning of the last four digits, macro data specialists have assigned 
codes with consistent leading vote-getters in a polity being assigned lower
values. Beyond this, the allocation of the final four digits is random. 

The harmonized and consistent codes for parties/coalitions are detailed
in Part 3 of the CSES IMD Codebook. Users can search for the 
following term: "CSES IMD HARMONIZED PARTY/COALITION NUMERICAL CODES"


<<>> CSES IMD NUMERICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING - IMPORTANT NOTES

In cases of a merger between two parties, the newly created party/coalition
receives a different numerical code from its previous incarnations. 

When parties compete in electoral alliances/coalitions, the 
alliance/coalition receives a different numerical code from the constituent 
parties that make it up. 

Parties/coalitions that merely undergo a name change do not receive a new 
unique code. Instead, a POLITY/ELECTION STUDY NOTE will note the name
change. 


<<>> CSES IMD ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING - RELATIONAL DATA

CSES IMD includes relational data for parties/coalitions. In CSES IMD, as 
in Standalone CSES Modules, this data is coded using an ALPHABETICAL 
classification with parties/coalitions where data is available receiving 
an alphabetical code (A-I). 

Parties/coalition A through F are the six most popular parties/coalitions, 
ordered in descending order of their share of the popular vote in the said
polity's election (unless otherwise stated). Thus Party A is the 
party/coalition  that received the most votes in the election, party B the 
second most votes, etc...         
Parties/coalitions who achieve at least 1% of the vote nationally are 
eligible for an alphabetical A-F assignment. In countries with multiple 
electoral tiers and where one vote is cast, parties are ordered according
to their vote share in tier 1 (the lowest tier), unless otherwise stated. 
In countries where voters have two votes (i.e., a constituency and a list  
vote) simultaneously, for example Germany, parties are ordered by the 
national share of the party list vote (tier 2).

Parties G, H, and I are supplemental parties. They may, but do not have to,
accord with how parties A-F are ordered, that is ordered on the popular 
share of the vote in a country. More often, they are codified in no 
particular order. These parties are voluntarily provided by each polity's
election study and often reflect important or notable parties within a 
polity. They may also include data about individual parties within a 
coalition, where data about the coalition and the individual parties, 
or some of these parties that make it up, are provided.

These codes are used to identify the following in the micro-component of 
the CSES dataset: 

   - Respondent's left-right placement of the party/coalition 
     (variable IMD3007).
   - Respondent's likeability of the party/coalition (variable IMD3008). 

These alphabetical codes are used to identify the distinct and macro level 
information about these said parties/coalitions, namely:

   - Expert judgments by the national collaborators of the said party/
     coalition's left-right placement (variable IMD5012).

To allow users to see what party/coalition A-I refers to in a particular 
election within a polity, variable IMD5000 provides identifiers within
the dataset with detailed labels. In addition, Part 4 of the CSES IMD 
Codebook details the alphabetical classifications for each polity by 
Standalone CSES Module. Users can search in Part 4 of the CSES IMD 
Codebook with the following term: "ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION CODES BY
CSES MODULE"


<<>> CSES ALPHABETICAL LEADER CODING

CSES IMD includes relational data for leaders of parties/coalitions. In
CSES IMD, as in Standalone CSES Modules, this data is coded using an
ALPHABETICAL classification with leaders where data is available receiving
an alphabetical code (A-I). 

Leaders A through F tend to be the leaders of the six most popular 
parties/coalitions or the presidential candidates of these parties. They 
correspond to parties A-F (i.e., Leader A will be related to Party A in 
some way, Leader B will be related to Party B, etc...) 

Leaders G, H, and I are supplemental leaders. They may be related to 
parties G, H, I, but they do not have to be. These leaders are voluntarily
provided by each country's election study and often include data about
additional personalities of interest. For example, in a parliamentary 
system, data about a President might be provided, even if the Presidency 
is not being contested. On many occasions, slots for Leader G, H, and I will 
include additional data for parties/coalitions that have multiple leaders. 
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro and macro 
components of the CSES dataset: 

   - Respondent's likeability of the leader/personality in question 
     (variable IMD3009). 

To allow users to see what Leader A-I refers to in a particular 
election within a polity, Part 4 of the CSES IMD Codebook details the 
alphabetical classifications of leaders for each polity by Standalone CSES 
Module. Users can search in Part 4 of the CSES IMD Codebook with the 
following term: "ALPHABETICAL LEADER CODES BY CSES MODULE"


===========================================================================
))) CSES IMD PARTY/COALITION HARMONIZED NUMERICAL CODES BY POLITY
===========================================================================

This section details the harmonized numerical codes by polity for each 
political party/coalition in CSES IMD. 

This seven-digit numerical identifier contains information on the polity
and a unique numerical value to distinguish the party/coalition. 

Some codes are consistent across polities, namely: 
   - 9999988: None of the candidates/parties 
   - 9999989: Independent candidate 
   - 9999990: Other left-wing candidate/party (not further specified)
   - 9999991: Other right-wing candidate/party (not further specified) 
   - 9999992: Other candidate/party (not further specified) 
   - 9999993: Invalid/Blank Ballot 

For the most part, these codes are not listed in the below list except
in special circumstances with an accompanying POLITY NOTE or ELECTION 
STUDY NOTE. 

Polities are listed below in alphabetical order.
