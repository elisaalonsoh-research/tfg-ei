))) IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING PHASE 3 RELEASE OF THE CSES INTEGRATED 
    MODULE DATASET (IMD)
===========================================================================

This dataset and all accompanying documentation comprises the Phase 3 
Release of the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD). 

The CSES Integrated Module Dataset is being released in a phased way. Thus,
this release is an advance version of the dataset, and thus lacks some of
the checking, documentation, and inclusion of certain variables that are 
expected with the Full Release of this dataset. 

This Phase 3 Release is provided as a service to the CSES user community,
for those analysts who find it valuable to work with preliminary versions
of the dataset. We would appreciate being notified of any errors in the
dataset or documentation by email to "cses@umich.edu".

Users should expect future changes and improvements to the data and 
documentation of variables. If users wish to re-use their programming code 
on a future release of the file, the code should be written in a way that 
is flexible and can be accommodating of these future changes.

Users of the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD) may wish to monitor the 
errata for CSES IMD on the CSES website, to check for known errors which 
may impact their analyses. To view errata for CSES IMD Phase 3, go to the 
Data Center on the CSES website, navigate to the CSES IMD download page, 
and click on the Errata link in the gray box to the right of the page.

Users of the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD) are also advised that 
while the CSES IMD Codebook is comprehensive, users are strongly advised
to consult Standalone Module documentation including Standalone Module 
Codebooks, Macro Reports, Design Reports and Election Summaries.

))) OVERVIEW OF "CODEBOOK PART 4: PARTIES/COALITIONS AND LEADERS,
                 ALPHABETICAL CODES (RELATIONAL DATA)"
===========================================================================

Part 4 of the CSES IMD Codebook identifies and details the ALPHABETICAL 
codes (A-I) used in CSES IMD to code relational data for parties/coalitions 
and leaders participating in a polity's national election. 

The alphabetical classifications assigned to parties/coalitions and leaders
for which we have relational data are listed by polity. In contrast
to the numerical party codes (see CSES IMD Codebook Part 3), the
alphabetical codes are not harmonized across election studies within the
same polity. 


===========================================================================

===========================================================================

A unique dimension of the CSES are the inclusion of POLITY NOTES and
ELECTION STUDY NOTES. They are notes which are attached to each 
variable included in the dataset and refer to case-specific 
information regarding a particular variable. This information
may apply to a polity consistently in the dataset (i.e.: a POLITY NOTE)
or one election study in the dataset (i.e.: an ELECTION STUDY NOTE). 
Their purpose is to provide users with more detailed information on the 
case or explain essential deviations specific to cases from CSES 
conventions. 

They can be navigated in the Codebook by searching for "POLITY NOTES" or
"ELECTION STUDY NOTES" in Parts 2-5 of the CSES IMD Codebook.


===========================================================================
))) CSES DATA BRIDGING: NEW FRONTIERS
===========================================================================

Data Bridging enables users to bring together information from CSES with 
other data sources. The concept is part of CSES Data Linkage efforts. CSES
has been a pioneer of Data Linkage with the inclusion of various 
macro-level data originating from other sources (e.g., The World Bank, 
the IDEA) directly in CSES data products, including in CSES IMD. These 
macro data classify the political system's characteristics and contextual 
conditions of a polity at the election time.  
Data Bridging gives users the power to build on the direct data linkage 
in CSES products by enabling users to easily link other data with CSES 
products. CSES IMD enables users to bridge data with other prominent 
datasets in political science by including standard identifiers at the
polity, year, and party level used by other projects to facilitate 
merging.

CSES IMD facilitates data bridging with other datasets at the polity level
with the following variables:
    - IMD1006_UN       ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN ISO_3166-1 NUMERIC CODE
    - IMD1006_UNAlpha2 ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN ISO_3166-1 ALPHABETIC

===========================================================================

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES CODING OF PARTY/COALITIONS AND LEADERS IN CSES IMD - A NEW 
    DEPARTURE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> CSES IMD NUMERICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING - HARMONIZATION

CSES IMD marks a radical new departure in the CSES approach to the coding
of parties and coalitions. All parties/coalitions or presidential
candidates, where applicable, participating in the election or the previous
election receive a NUMERICAL code. These codes are used to identify the
following: 

   - who the respondent voted for in the current election (IMD3002). 
   - who the respondent voted for in the previous election (IMD3004).
   - the respondent's party identification (IMD3005_3).

In CSES IMD, each party/coalition receives a unique numerical identifier 
that is consistent across modules. This seven-digit numerical identifier 
contains information on the polity and a unique numerical value to 
distinguish the party/coalition. Hence, numerical party/coalition codes 
are harmonized across Modules within CSES IMD. 

The first three digits of the identifier consist of the three-digit UN 
Polity Identifier Code. The remaining four digits consist of numerical 
codes ranging from 0001 to 9999 with each party/coalition assigned a value 
that remains consistent across Modules.   
In assigning of the last four digits, macro data specialists have assigned 
codes with consistent leading vote-getters in a polity being assigned lower
values. Beyond this, the allocation of the final four digits is random. 

The harmonized and consistent codes for parties/coalitions are detailed
in Part 3 of the CSES IMD Codebook. Users can search for the 
following term: "CSES IMD HARMONIZED PARTY/COALITION NUMERICAL CODES"


<<>> CSES IMD NUMERICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING - IMPORTANT NOTES

In cases of a merger between two parties, the newly created party/coalition
receives a different numerical code from its previous incarnations. 

When parties compete in electoral alliances/coalitions, the 
alliance/coalition receives a different numerical code from the constituent 
parties that make it up. 

Parties/coalitions that merely undergo a name change do not receive a new 
unique code. Instead a POLITY/ELECTION STUDY NOTE will note the name
change. 


<<>> CSES IMD ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING - RELATIONAL DATA

CSES IMD includes relational data for parties/coalitions. In CSES IMD, as 
in Standalone CSES Modules, this data is coded using an ALPHABETICAL 
classification with parties/coalitions where data is available receiving 
an alphabetical code (A-I). 

Parties/coalitions A through F are the six most popular parties/coalitions, 
ordered in descending order of their share of the popular vote in the said
polity's election (unless otherwise stated). Thus Party A is the 
party/coalition that received the most votes in the election, party B the 
second most votes, etc...         
Parties/coalitions who achieve at least 1% of the vote nationally are 
eligible for an alphabetical A-F assignment. In countries with multiple 
electoral tiers and where one vote is cast, parties are ordered according
to their vote share in tier 1 (the lowest tier), unless otherwise stated. 
In countries where voters have two votes (i.e., a constituency and a list  
vote) simultaneously, for example Germany, parties are ordered by the 
national share of the party list vote (tier 2).

Parties G, H, and I are supplemental parties. They may, but do not have to,
accord with how parties A-F are ordered, that is ordered on the popular 
share of the vote in a country. More often, they are codified in no 
particular order. These parties are voluntarily provided by each polity's
election study and often reflect important or notable parties within a 
polity. They may also include data about individual parties within a 
coalition, where data about the coalition and the individual parties, 
or some of these parties that make it up, are provided.

These codes are used to identify the following in the micro-component of 
the CSES dataset: 

   - Respondent's left-right placement of the party/coalition 
     (variable IMD3007).
   - Respondent's likeability of the party/coalition (variable IMD3008). 

These alphabetical codes are used to identify the distinct and macro level 
information about these said parties/coalitions, namely:

   - Expert judgments by the national collaborators of the said party/
     coalition's left-right placement (variable IMD5012).

To allow users to see what party/coalition A-I refers to in a particular 
election within a polity, variable IMD5000 provides identifiers within
the dataset with detailed labels. In addition, Part 4 of the CSES IMD 
Codebook details the alphabetical classifications for each polity by 
Standalone CSES Module. Users can search in Part 4 of the CSES IMD 
Codebook with the following term: "ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION CODES BY
CSES MODULE"


<<>> CSES ALPHABETICAL LEADER CODING

CSES IMD includes relational data for leaders of parties/coalitions. In
CSES IMD, as in Standalone CSES Modules, this data is coded using an
ALPHABETICAL classification with leaders where data is available receiving
an alphabetical code (A-I). 

Leaders A through F tend to be the leaders of the six most popular 
parties/coalitions or the presidential candidates of these parties. They 
correspond to parties A-F (i.e., Leader A will be related to Party A in 
some way, Leader B will be related to Party B, etc...) 

Leaders G, H, and I are supplemental leaders. They may be related to 
parties G, H, I but they do not have to be. These leaders are voluntarily
provided by each country's election study and often include data about
additional personalities of interest. For example, in a parliamentary 
system, data about a President might be provided, even if the Presidency 
is not being contested. On many occasions, slots for Leader G, H, and I
will include additional data for parties/coalitions that have multiple
leaders. These codes are used to identify the following in the micro and
macro components of the CSES dataset: 

   - Respondent's likeability of the leader/personality in question 
     (variable IMD3009). 

To allow users to see what Leader A-I refers to in a particular 
election within a polity, Part 4 of the CSES IMD Codebook details the 
alphabetical classifications of leaders for each polity by Standalone CSES 
Module. Users can search in Part 4 of the CSES IMD Codebook with the 
following term: "ALPHABETICAL LEADER CODES BY CSES MODULE"


===========================================================================
))) ALPHABETICAL PARTY CODES FOR CSES IMD BY CSES MODULE AND POLITY 
===========================================================================

This section details the relational data (i.e., in Standalone CSES Modules 
data which was collected and involved the assigning of alphabetical codes) 
for political parties/coalitions. These data are related to several 
different measures in CSES IMD.

The first is respondent's likeability of parties/coalitions. The question 
asked of respondents was:  
   "I'd like to know what you think about each of our political parties.
    After I read the name of a political party, please rate it on a scale
    from 0 to 10, where 0 means you strongly dislike that party and 10
    means that you strongly like that party. If I come to a party you
    haven't heard of or you feel you do not know enough about, just
    say so."

These data were available in Standalone CSES Modules 1-4. The corresponding 
variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
   - MODULE 1: A3020_A-I
   - MODULE 2: B3037_A-I
   - MODULE 3: C3009_A-I
   - MODULE 4: D3011_A-I

The second is the placement of parties on the left-right ideological scale 
by respondents. The question asked of respondents was: 
   "In politics people sometimes talk of left and right. Where would you
    place [PARTY A] on a scale from 0 to 10 where 0 means the left and 10
    means the right?"

These data were available in Standalone CSES Modules 1-4. The corresponding 
variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
   - MODULE 1: A3032_A-I
   - MODULE 2: B3038_A-I
   - MODULE 3: C3011_A-I
   - MODULE 4: D3013_A-I

The third is the placement of parties on the left-right ideological scale 
by national collaborators. The question asked of national collaborators was: 
   "Please indicate party positions on a left-right dimension (in the
    expert judgment of the CSES Collaborator). Please use the same parties
    that were used in the CSES Module 4 respondent questionnaire, and label
    them the same way (A-I)."

These data were available in Standalone CSES Modules 1-4. The corresponding
variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are:
   - MODULE 1: A5004_A-I
   - MODULE 2: B5018_A-I
   - MODULE 3: C5017_A-I
   - MODULE 4: D5017_A-I

The fourth is the expert judgment by the national collaborators as to which
ideological family each party belongs to. Collaborators are presented with 
a list of suggestions for ideological party family groups. If collaborators 
find a particular party does not fit well into this classification scheme, 
they are asked to provide an alternative ideological family group for that 
party and some explanation.

These data were available in Standalone CSES Modules 1-4. The corresponding 
variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are:        
   - MODULE 1: A5002_A-I
   - MODULE 2: B5012_A-I
   - MODULE 3: C5016_A-I
   - MODULE 4: D5016_A-I
  
The fifth is the results of the current election, i.e., the percentage of 
popular vote and seats for each party/coalition in the respective Lower 
House, Upper House, or Presidential Election, if applicable. The question 
asked of national collaborators was:
   "Please list all parties who received at least 1 percent of the vote 
    nationally, and the applicable electoral results for each, in the

The sixth measure is the number of cabinet portfolios held by each party/
coalition before the election. The question asked of national collaborators
was:
   "Report the number of cabinet ministers of each party or parties in 
    cabinet, prior to the most recent election. (If one party holds all 
    cabinet posts, simply write "all".) Ministers are considered those 
    members of government who are members of the Cabinet and who have 
    Cabinet voting rights. List also cabinet members that are 
    ‘independent’. If known, specify if the ‘independents’ are affiliated 
    or close to certain parties."

These data were available in Standalone CSES Modules 2-4. The corresponding
variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are:
   - MODULE 1: Not included         
   - MODULE 2: B5007_A-I (Number of Portfolios Before)

coalition after the election. The question asked of national collaborators
was:
   "Report the number of cabinet ministers of each party or parties in 
    cabinet, after the most recent election. (If one party holds all 
    cabinet posts, simply write "all"). Ministers are considered those 
    members of government who are members of the Cabinet and who have 
    Cabinet voting rights. List also cabinet members that are

In the below lists, modules are abbreviated: M1=Module 1; M2=Module 2;
M3=Module 3; M4=Module 4.

Political parties within each polity are listed in ascending order of 
numerical codes assigned in CSES IMD. Official abbreviations for 
parties/coalitions are provided where possible. 

In instances where a polity fielded the same Module twice (e.g., Brazil 
for Module 3), accompanying POLITY NOTES detail the alphabetical
assignment for each election study within that module for that polity.
Where a polity did not appear in a particular module, we use "-". Polities
are listed below in alphabetical order.

CSES IMD also enables users to data bridge - link CSES data to other
data themselves on several levels of analysis including the party/coalition
level. CSES IMD facilitates data bridging with at the party/coalition for
any party/coalition assigned an alphabetical code in a CSES election study.
CSES IMD enables this form of data bridging through the following
variables:
    - IMD5100_A-I      MANIFESTO RESEARCH ON POLITICAL REPRESENTATION
                       (MARPOR/CMP) IDENTIFIER - PARTY A-I
    - IMD5101_A-I      PARLIAMENTS AND GOVERNMENT DATABASE (PARLGOV)
                       IDENTIFIER - PARTY A-I
    - IMD5102_A-I      CHAPEL HILL EXPERT SURVEY (CHES) IDENTIFIER -
                       PARTY A-I
    - IMD5103_A-I      PARTY FACTS IDENTIFIER - PARTY A-I
 
Part 5 of the CSES IMD Codebook details data bridging identifiers from
other comparative projects and users are advised to consult here for
more information.

))) ALPHABETICAL LEADER CODES FOR CSES IMD BY CSES MODULE AND POLITY 
===========================================================================

This section details the relational data (i.e., in Standalone CSES Modules 
data which was collected and involved the assigning of alphabetical codes) 
for political leaders. 

These data refer to leader likeability. The question asked of respondents 
was:
 "And what do you think of the presidential candidates/party leaders? After 
  I read the name of a presidential candidate/party leader, please rate
  them on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means you strongly dislike that
  candidate and 10 means that you strongly like that candidate. If I come
  to a presidential candidate/party leader you haven't heard of or you feel
  you do not know enough about, just say so."

These data were available in Standalone CSES Modules 1, 3, and 4. No leader 
likeability data was collected for CSES Module 2. However, in Australia and
Brazil, leader likeability data was included as part of the optional scales
fielded in these countries. These data are also included in CSES IMD but
are not listed in the below entries. Instead, users are advised to consult
the Standalone CSES Module Codebooks for Module 2 - variable B3041. 

The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
   - MODULE 1: A3021_A-I          
   - MODULE 2: Not included    
   - MODULE 3: C3010_A-I 
   - MODULE 4: D3012_A-I

In the below lists, modules are abbreviated: M1=Module 1; M3=Module 3;
M4=Module 4.

Leaders within each polity are listed according to numerical code assigned
in CSES IMD to the party/coalition which they lead or are associated with. 
For example, in Canada, leaders of the Liberal Party (LIB) are listed 
first because the Liberal Party has been assigned the numerical code
1240001 in CSES IMD. Leaders of the Conservative Party (CP) are then listed
as they have been assigned the numerical code 1240002 etc... After this, 
leaders are then listed in chronological order beginning with the oldest
election for the said polity. We also provide the abbreviation of the
party/coalition the leader is associated with. 

In instances where a polity fielded the same Module twice (e.g., Brazil 
for Module 3), accompanying POLITY NOTES detail the alphabetical assignment
for each election study within that module for that polity. Leader names 
are listed with Christian name first followed by the surname. Where a
polity did not appear in a particular module, we use "-". Polities are
listed below in alphabetical order.

         | political career. After leaving the Liberal Democratic Party 
         | (LDP) in 1993, Ozawa ran for the New Frontier Party (NFP) in
         | the 1996 Japanese general election (CSES MODULE 1). At the time
         | of the 2007 Upper House Elections (CSES MODULE 3), Ozawa led the
         | Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). He changed party membership 
         | once again in 2012, founding both the party People's Life First
         | and the People's Life Party (now: Liberal Party). Thus, at the
         | time of the 2013 Upper House elections (CSES MODULE 4), Ichiro

         |
         | The CSES MODULE 1, 3 and 4 questionnaires were fielded twice in 
         | Mexico. The table above lists ALPHABETICAL leader codes. Thus,
         | ALPHABETICAL leader codes before the dashes refer to the study
         | that included the respective CSES MODULE first, while codes
         | after the dashes refer to the later study. Specifically, for
         | Mexico, ALPHABETICAL codes refer to:
         | CSES MODULE 1: MEXICO 1997 / MEXICO 2000
         | CSES MODULE 3: MEXICO 2006 / MEXICO 2009
         | CSES MODULE 4: MEXICO 2012 / MEXICO 2015        
         |
         | Leader codes for 2000 (M1), 2006 (M3), and 2012 (M4) refer to 
         | presidential candidates.          
         |
         | Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is listed as being affiliated to 
         | the Labor Party (PT) for Mexico 2009. However, Obrador was
         | member of the Democratic Revolution Party (PRD) from 1989 to
         | 2012.
