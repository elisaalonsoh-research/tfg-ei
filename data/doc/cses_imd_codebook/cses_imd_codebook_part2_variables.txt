    MODULE DATASET (IMD)
===========================================================================

This dataset and all accompanying documentation comprises the Phase 3 
Release of the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD). 

The CSES Integrated Module Dataset is being released in a phased way. Thus, 
this release is an advance version of the dataset, and thus lacks some of
the checking, documentation, and inclusion of certain variables that are 
expected with the Full Release of this dataset. 

This Advance Release is provided as a service to the CSES user community,
for those analysts who find it valuable to work with preliminary versions
of the dataset. We would appreciate being notified of any errors in the
dataset or documentation by email to "cses@umich.edu".

Users should expect future changes and improvements to the data and 
documentation of variables. If users wish to re-use their programming code 
on a future release of the file, the code should be written in a way that 
is flexible and can be accommodating of these future changes.

Users of the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD) may wish to monitor the 
errata for CSES IMD on the CSES website, to check for known errors which 
may impact their analyses. To view errata for CSES IMD Phase 3, go to 
Data Download on the CSES website, navigate to the CSES IMD download page, 
and click on the Errata link in the white box to the right of the page.

Users of the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD) are also advised that 
while the CSES IMD Codebook is comprehensive, users are strongly advised
to consult Standalone CSES Module Documentation including Standalone CSES  
Module Codebooks, Macro Reports, Design Reports, and Election Summaries.

===========================================================================
))) CSES IMD CODEBOOK: CRITICAL CRITERIA REGARDING CSES IMD AND 
    DESCRIPTION OF VARIABLE NOTES, POLITY NOTES; & ELECTION STUDY NOTES
===========================================================================

Here we provide a brief overview of some of the critical criteria regarding 
the creation of CSES IMD and some crucial things users may wish to take 
account of in analyzing data from CSES IMD.

Variables are presented in five groupings:

1) IMD1001-IMD1999 Identification, weight, and election study variables

2) IMD2001-IMD2999 Demographic data and variables

3) IMD3001-IMD3999 Micro-level (survey) data and variables

4) IMD5001-IMD5099 Macro-level data and variables 

5) IMD5100-IMD5199 Data Bridging identifier variables 

In the Variable Descriptions section of the CSES IMD Codebook (Part 2), 
the headers for individual variables are surrounded by two lines of dashes.

Users are advised to consult Part 1 of the CSES IMD Codebook for 
more in-depth information concerning the operating principles of CSES IMD, 
its coding conventions, details on identification and missing data, and 
overviews of the dataset including detailed summary information on the 
election studies included in CSES IMD. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> PLACEMENT OF QUESTIONS IN CSES IMD AND STANDALONE CSES MODULES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using variables in the CSES IMD, users are advised that even when a
question is worded identically in successive surveys, its placement in the
survey questionnaire may be different in each Standalone CSES Module, with
unknown effects. Thus, even when a question is worded identically in 
successive surveys, analysts may wish to examine the placement of the 
question in each questionnaire to ensure that changes in its placement do 
not contaminate analyses. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> RECODING OF VARIABLES FOR CSES IMD
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variables for CSES IMD have been recoded to be consistent over time. 
Questions (and variables) are not necessarily coded the same way in CSES
IMD as they are in the Standalone CSES Modules. Users are advised to 
consult the CSES IMD Codebook Part 2, where possible, details have been
provided in VARIABLE NOTES and ELECTION STUDY NOTES regarding harmonization
schemes and specific election study deviations. Users are also advised to 
consult Standalone CSES Module Codebooks for specific information on
Module-specific studies. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> DEVIATIONS FROM STANDALONE CSES MODULES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CSES goal is to keep deviations between Standalone CSES Modules and
CSES IMD to a minimum. Nonetheless, despite question wordings being
virtually identical across CSES modules, CSES IMD harmonizes variables to
be consistent over time, thus necessitating some deviations to occur. 
These deviations may occur because of coding errors found in the 
Standalone CSES dataset or Standalone Codebooks. In these circumstances, 
these errors may result in changes being implemented in CSES IMD 
and the issues listed in errata on the Standalone CSES Module pages. These 
issues will be corrected in the Standalone CSES Modules upon re-release of 
these respective Standalone CSES Modules at some future date. 

Deviations may also legitimately arise because of different coding schemes 
applied in Standalone CSES Modules compared with CSES IMD, lack of data at 
the time of processing of Standalone CSES Modules which has since become 
available, or that data for certain variables were not collected in 
particular Standalone CSES Modules but have become eligible for inclusion 
in CSES IMD as it meets the "3 and 1" eligibility criteria.

In line with the policy of minimizing differences between CSES IMD and
Standalone CSES Modules, CSES only applies deviations between CSES IMD and
Standalone CSES Modules when the above circumstances are met. In
circumstances where CSES is unable to explain why coding differs between
studies from the same polity over time, no changes are made to the data. 

Concerning deviations, Election Study Notes and Polity Notes are included 
under the applicable variables noting the deviations. Irregular codes 
discovered in Standalone CSES Modules and which could not  
be identified were set to missing. These are also noted in Variable Notes
and Election Study Notes. Users can identify these by using the following
unique search terms in Part 2 of the CSES IMD Codebook: 
   - VARIABLE NOTES
   - [POLITY NOTES]
   - [ELECTION STUDY NOTES]


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> VARIABLE NOTES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variable notes provide information on the rationale of a variable 
as well as source information for that variable. It also details the 
polities for which no data for that particular variable are available. 
VARIABLE NOTES are listed below the descriptive information for the said
variable and can be navigated in the Codebook by searching for 
"VARIABLE NOTES" in Part 2 of the CSES IMD Codebook. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> POLITY NOTES AND ELECTION STUDY NOTES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A unique dimension of the CSES are the inclusion of POLITY NOTES and
ELECTION STUDY NOTES. They are notes which are attached to each 
variable included in the dataset and refer to case-specific 
information regarding a particular variable. This information
may apply to a polity consistently in the dataset (i.e.: a POLITY NOTE)
or one election study in the dataset (i.e.: an ELECTION STUDY NOTE). 
Their purpose is to provide users with more detailed information on the 
case or explain essential deviations specific to cases from CSES 
conventions.

Where applicable, POLITY NOTES and ELECTION STUDY NOTES are listed 
below a particular variable and any VARIABLE NOTES in Parts 2, 3, and 4
of the CSES IMD Codebook. They can be navigated in the Codebook by 
searching for "POLITY NOTES" or ELECTION STUDY NOTES" in Parts 2-5 
of the CSES IMD Codebook.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> DERIVATIVE VARIABLES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSES IMD includes several derivative variables. A derivative variable is a
variable that is derived from another variable or variables within the CSES.
Their purpose is to facilitate speedier analysis for users with derivative
variables capturing some of the most common analytical concepts in the
discipline.

A list of the DERIVATIVE VARIABLES are below this explanation and can be
navigated in the Codebook by searching for "DERIVATIVE VARIABLES" in
Part 2 of the CSES IMD Codebook.

))) CSES CODING OF PARTY/COALITIONS AND LEADERS IN CSES IMD - A NEW 
    DEPARTURE
===========================================================================

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES IMD NUMERICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING - HARMONIZATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSES IMD marks a radical new departure in the CSES approach to the coding of
parties and coalitions. All parties/coalitions or presidential candidates, 
where applicable, participating in the election or the previous election 
receive a NUMERICAL code. 
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro-component of 
the CSES dataset: 

   - who the respondent voted for in the current election (IMD3002). 
   - who the respondent voted for in the previous election (IMD3004).
   - the respondent's party identification (IMD3005_3).

These codes are used to identify the following in the macro-component of
the CSES dataset:

   - Party/coalition of the prime minister before the election 
     (IMD5008_)
   - Party/coalition of the president before and after the election 
     (IMD5009_)

In CSES IMD, each party/coalition receives a unique numerical identifier 
that is consistent across modules. This seven-digit numerical identifier 
contains information on the polity and a unique numerical value to 
distinguish the party/coalition. Hence, numerical party/coalition codes 
are harmonized across Modules within CSES IMD. 

The first three digits of the identifier consist of the three-digit UN 
Polity Identifier Code. The remaining four digits consist of numerical 
codes ranging from 0001 to 9999, with each party/coalition assigned a value 
that remains consistent across Modules.   
In assigning of the last four digits, macro data specialists have assigned 
codes with consistent leading vote-getters in a polity being assigned lower 
values. Beyond this, the allocation of the final four digits is random. 

The harmonized and consistent codes for parties/coalitions are detailed
in Part 3 of the CSES IMD Codebook. Users can search for the 
following term: "CSES IMD HARMONIZED PARTY/COALITION NUMERICAL CODES"


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES IMD NUMERICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING - IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In cases of a merger between two parties, the newly created party/coalition
receives a different numerical code from its previous incarnations. 

When parties compete in electoral alliances/coalitions, the 
alliance/coalition receives a different numerical code from the constituent 
parties that make it up. 

Parties/coalitions that merely undergo a name change do not receive a new 
unique code. Instead, a POLITY/ELECTION STUDY NOTE will note the name 
change.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES IMD ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING - RELATIONAL DATA
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSES IMD includes relational data for parties/coalitions. In CSES IMD, as 
in Standalone CSES Modules, this data is coded using an ALPHABETICAL 
classification with parties/coalitions where data is available receiving 
an alphabetical code (A-I). 

Parties/coalitions A through F are the six most popular parties/coalitions, 
ordered in descending order of their share of the popular vote in the said
polity's election (unless otherwise stated). Thus Party A is the 
party/coalition that received the most votes in the election, party B the 
second most votes, etc...         
Parties/coalitions who achieve at least 1% of the vote nationally are 
eligible for an alphabetical A-F assignment. In polities with multiple 
electoral tiers and where one vote is cast, parties are ordered according
to their vote share in tier 1 (the lowest tier), unless otherwise stated. 
In polities where voters have two votes (i.e., a constituency and a list  
vote) simultaneously, for example Germany, parties are ordered by the 
national share of the party list vote (tier 2).

Parties G, H, and I are supplemental parties. They may, but do not have to,
accord with how parties A-F are ordered, that is ordered on the popular 
share of the vote in a polity. More often, they are codified in no 
particular order. These parties are voluntarily provided by each polity's
election study and often reflect important or notable parties within a 
polity. They may also include data about individual parties within a 
coalition, where data about the coalition and the individual parties, 
or some of these parties that make it up are provided.

These codes are used to identify the following in the micro-component of 
the CSES dataset: 

   - Respondent's left-right placement of the party/coalition 
     (variable IMD3007_).
   - Respondent's likability of the party/coalition (variable IMD3008_). 

These alphabetical codes are used to identify the macro level information 
about these said parties/coalitions, namely:

   - Election Results: percentage of vote for each party/coalition in lower
     house (variable IMD5001_)
   - Election Results: percentage of seats for each party/coalition in lower
     house (variable IMD5002_)
   - Election Results: percentage of vote for each party/coalition in upper
     house (variable IMD5003_)
   - Election Results: percentage of seats for each party/coalition in upper
     house (variable IMD5004_)
   - Election Results: percentage of vote for each party/coalition in 
     presidential election (variable IMD5005_)
   - Expert judgments by the national collaborators of the said party/
     coalition's ideological family placement (variable IMD5011_).
   - Expert judgments by the national collaborators of the said party/
     coalition's left-right placement (variable IMD5012_).
   - Number of cabinet portfolios held by each party/coalition before the 
     election (variable IMD5029_).
   - Number of cabinet portfolios held by each party/coalition after the 
     election (variable IMD5031_).     

To allow users to see what party/coalition A-I refers to in a particular 
election within a polity, variable IMD5000_ provides identifiers within
the dataset with detailed labels. In addition, Part 4 of the CSES IMD 
Codebook details the alphabetical classifications for each polity by 
Standalone CSES Module. Users can search in Part 4 of the CSES IMD 
Codebook with the following term: "ALPHABETICAL PARTY CODES BY CSES MODULE"


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES ALPHABETICAL LEADER CODING - RELATIONAL DATA
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSES IMD includes relational data for leaders of parties/coalitions. In CSES
IMD, as in Standalone CSES Modules, this data is coded using an ALPHABETICAL
classification with leaders where data is available receiving an 
alphabetical code (A-I). 

Leaders A through F tend to be the leaders of the six most popular 
parties/coalitions or the presidential candidates of these parties. They 
correspond to parties A-F (i.e., Leader A will be related to Party A in 
some way, Leader B will be related to Party B, etc...) 

Leaders G, H, and I are supplemental leaders. They may be related to 
parties G, H, I, but they do not have to be. These leaders are voluntarily
provided by each country's election study and often include data about
additional personalities of interest. For example, in a parliamentary 
system, data about a President might be provided, even if the Presidency 
is not being contested. On many occasions, slots Leader G, H, and I will 
include additional data for parties/coalitions that have multiple leaders. 
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro and macro 
components of the CSES dataset: 

   - Respondent's likability of the leader/personality in question 
     (variable IMD3009). 

To allow users to see what Leader A-I refers to in a particular 
election within a polity, Part 4 of the CSES IMD Codebook details the 
alphabetical classifications of leaders for each polity by Standalone CSES 
Module. Users can search in Part 4 of the CSES IMD Codebook with the 
following term: "ALPHABETICAL LEADER CODES BY CSES MODULE"


===========================================================================
))) CSES DATA BRIDGING: NEW FRONTIERS
===========================================================================

Data Bridging enables users to bring together information from CSES with 
other data sources. The concept is part of CSES Data Linkage efforts. CSES
has been a pioneer of Data Linkage with the inclusion of various 
macro-level data originating from other sources (e.g., The World Bank, 
the IDEA) directly in CSES data products, including in CSES IMD. These 
macro data classify the political system's characteristics and contextual 
conditions of a polity at the election time.  
Data Bridging gives users the power to build on the direct data linkage 
in CSES products by enabling users to easily link other data with CSES 
products. CSES IMD enables users to bridge data with other prominent 
datasets in political science by including standard identifiers at the
polity, year, and party level used by other projects to facilitate 
merging.

CSES IMD facilitates data bridging with other datasets at the polity level
with the following variables:
    - IMD1006_UN       ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN ISO_3166-1 NUMERIC CODE
    - IMD1006_UNAlpha2 ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN ISO_3166-1 ALPHABETIC
                                      TWO LETTER CODE
    - IMD1006_NAM      ID COMPONENT - POLITY NAME
    - IMD1006_VDem     ID COMPONENT - V-Dem POLITY IDENTIFIER
    
More details can be found on all these variables in CSES IMD Codebook 
Part 2 by searching for the variable name (e.g., "IMD1006_UN") or using
the search term "POTENTIAL POLITY LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER". 

CSES IMD facilitates data bridging with other datasets at the regional 
level through the following variables:  
    - IMD1006_REG      ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS NUMERIC
                                      CODES
More details can be found on all these variables in CSES IMD Codebook 
Part 2 by searching for the variable name (e.g., "IMD1006_REG") or using
the search term "POTENTIAL REGIONAL LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER". 

CSES IMD facilitates data bridging with other datasets by date through the
following variables:  
    - IMD1008_YEAR     ID COMPONENT - ELECTION YEAR
    - IMD1011_M        DATE 1ST ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - MONTH
    - IMD1011_D        DATE 1ST ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - DAY
    - IMD1011_Y        DATE 1ST ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - YEAR

    - IMD1012_1        DATE 2ND ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - YYYY-MM-DD
    - IMD1012_2        DATE 2ND ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - YYYYMM                 

More details can be found on all these variables in CSES IMD Codebook 
Part 2 by searching for the variable name (e.g., "IMD1008_YEAR") or using
the search term "POTENTIAL TIME BRIDGING IDENTIFIER". 

CSES IMD facilitates data bridging with other datasets at the
party/coalition level with the following variables: 
    - IMD5100_A-I      MANIFESTO RESEARCH ON POLITICAL REPRESENTATION 
                       (MARPOR/CMP) IDENTIFIER - PARTY A-I
    - IMD5101_A-I      PARLIAMENTS AND GOVERNMENT DATABASE (PARLGOV)

    - IMD5102_A-I      CHAPEL HILL EXPERT SURVEY (CHES) IDENTIFIER -
                       PARTY A-I
    - IMD5103_A-I      PARTY FACTS IDENTIFIER - PARTY A-I 

More details can be found on all these variables in CSES IMD Codebook 
Part 2 by searching for the variable name (e.g., "IMD5100_A") or using
the search term "POTENTIAL PARTY/COALITION LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER."
Users can also see the specific bridging codes for each party/coalition
assigned an alphabetical code in CSES by other projects in Part 5 of the
CSES IMD Codebook.

         |
         | This variable reports the name of the dataset. 
         | This dataset is the first version of the CSES INTEGRATED MODULE
         | DATA SET (CSES IMD), integrating data from CSES MODULE 1 to 
         | CSES MODULE 4.  
         | 
         | The Standalone CSES Modules were administered during the
         | following years (inclusive):
         |
         | MODULE 1: 1996 - 2001 - SEE BELOW
         | MODULE 2: 2001 - 2006
         | MODULE 3: 2006 - 2011 - SEE BELOW
         | MODULE 4: 2011 - 2016
         |         
         | MODULE 1 was principally administered between 1996 and 2001
         | but the 2002 Portuguese study administered both CSES MODULES      
         | 1 and 2 simultaneously.         
         |         
         | MODULE 3 was principally administered between 2006 and 2011
         | but the 2005 German, Polish, and Norwegian study administered 
         | CSES MODULE 3 pilot studies in 2005, with the CSES questionnaire
         | for MODULE 3 finalized in 2006.

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD1003
         |
         | This eight-digit variable uniquely identifies an election study
         | within CSES IMD.
         |
         | The variable is constructed from two components, variable IMD1006
         | (CSES polity code) and IMD1008_YEAR (election year).
         |
         | The first three digits are the numerical version of the polity
         | codes created by the United Nations Statistics Division
         | ("countries or areas, codes and abbreviations", revised February
         | 13, 2002), except for Taiwan (see ELECTION STUDY NOTE).
         |
         | The fourth digit distinguishes between multiple studies
         | conducted within a single polity, for the same election.
         |
         | The fifth through eighth digits correspond to the election year
         | as specified in variable IMD1008_YEAR.
         |         
         | Polities are listed in alphabetical order, followed by the  
         | chronological order of the study.  
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: A1003          
         | MODULE 2: B1003   
         | MODULE 3: C1003 
         | MODULE 4: D1003 

         | POLITY NOTES - TAIWAN: IMD1003
         |
         | As Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations, the polity code
         | assigned to Taiwan comes from the International Organization of 
         | Standards (ISO) 3166 polity classification, which the UN approach 
         | scheme largely mirrors.

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD1004
         |
         | This eight-character variable uniquely identifies an election
         | study within the CSES IMD.
         |
         | The variable is constructed from two components, alphabetic 
         | country codes (ISO 3166, 'alpha-3') and IMD1008_YEAR 
         | (election year).
         |
         | The first three characters are the alphabetic country codes
         | 'alpha-3' created by the International Organization for 
         | Standardization in their ISO 3166 Standard and shared by the
         | United Nations Statistics Division ("Countries or areas, codes
         | and abbreviations", revised February 13, 2002).
         |
         | If appropriate, the fourth character distinguishes between
         | multiple studies conducted within a single country, for the same
         | election. If only one study is in place for the election, this
         | character appears as an underscore (_).
         |
         | The fifth through eighth characters correspond to the election
         | year as specified in variable IMD1008_YEAR.
         |         
         | Polities are listed in alphabetical order, followed by the  
         | chronological order of the study. 
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: A1004

         ..................................................................


         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD1005
         |
         | This eighteen-character variable uniquely identifies a
         | respondent within the CSES IMD.
         | It equals the original respondent IDs from the Standalone CSES
         | Modules (A1005, B1005, C1005, D1005). Therefore, users who want 
         | to merge additional CSES variables not covered by the present
         | data set may do so by using this variable as the basis for
         | merging.
         |
         | The variable is constructed from three components: variable
         | IMD1006 (CSES polity code), IMD1008_YEAR (election year), and 
         | IMD1008_RES (respondent within election study).
         |
         | The first three characters are the numeric version of the
         | country codes created by the United Nations Statistics
         | Division ("countries or areas, codes and abbreviations",
         | revised February 13, 2002).
         |
         | If appropriate, the fourth character distinguishes between
         | multiple studies conducted within a single country, for the same
         | election. If only one study is in place for the election, this
         | character appears as a zero (0).
         |
         | The fifth through eighth characters correspond to the election
         | year as specified in variable IMD1008_YEAR.
         |
         | The last ten characters are the respondent identifier from
         | IMD1008_RES, which is unique within each election study.
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: A1005          
         | MODULE 2: B1005

         | POTENTIAL POLITY LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER
         |
         | This four-character variable uniquely identifies a polity
         | conducting an election study that is present in the CSES
         | IMD.
         |
         | The first three characters are the numerical version of
         | the polity codes created by the United Nations Statistics
         | Division ("countries or areas, codes and abbreviations",
         | revised February 13, 2002).
         |
         | The fourth character distinguishes between multiple studies
         | conducted within a single polity, for the same election.
         |
         | Polities are listed in alphabetical order. 
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: A1006          
         | MODULE 2: B1006   
         | MODULE 3: C1006

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - UNITED STATES (2012): IMD1006
         |
         | The 2012 American Election Study consisted of two sample 
         | components. The fourth digit in the Standalone CSES MODULE 4
         | was used to indicate the 2 components. Hence, IMD1006 differs
         | from all other election studies for the United States which
         | are included in the CSES IMD.

         In some cases, analysts may wish to consider regions of countries
         or other sample components units of analysis, rather than the
         countries themselves. We use this variable to capture information
         about subsets of respondents that are meaningful but that are not
         captured by other variables. This may, for instance, refer to
         different sample components or respondents from different panel
         components. For all other cases, this variable is coded 001.

         | The Argentinean election survey was conducted in two waves.
         | Only the second wave of the survey is used for CSES. It 
         | contained 780 respondents who had been sampled initially
         | for the first survey as well as a refresh sample of 626 
         | respondents.

         | Sample component here refers to the language of the
         | questionnaire. This variable is entered by interviewers and is
         | important because questionnaires differ most notably in their
         | inclusion of different sets of political parties. Election study
         | notes for variables in the B3037 series (Codebook Part 2,
         | MODULE 2) include information about which of the two 
         | questionnaire versions a particular party was included.

         | questionnaire (see also Election Study Note for D1023 on Survey

         | The Campaign Wave (6 = postal campaign): A pre-election survey
         | was conducted over the course of the campaign to track short-
         | term changes in voting behavior. The rolling cross-section was
         | conducted 5 September through 11 October, during which time
         | approximately 120 computer-assisted telephone interviews per
         | day were conducted with randomly selected New Zealanders of
         | voting age. Respondents' names and addresses were also requested
         | and those who supplied them were sent a postal questionnaire
         | after the election.
         |
         | The post-election wave of the campaign sample was added to the

         | New Zealand respondents of Maori descent can choose to be 
         | registered on a separate Maori roll, and cast their electorate 
         | votes within seven constituencies that overlie the general 
         | electorates. For its new sample, the 2008 NZES sampled
         | within four subsets of registered voters and over-sampled
         | subsets 1, 3, and 4 below, groups of particular interest to the
         | researchers. For the CSES release, respondents from the three
         | over-sampled subsets were re-sampled to bring their numbers into
         | the appropriate proportions among registered voters, removing
         | any need for sampling weights.

         | D2022, D2023, D2025, and D2027. To allow distinguishing between 
         | these groups, the sample component not only reflects the two 
         | waves but also the length of the questionnaire. Finally, 22 
         | respondents in the sample were first-time voters who were not 
         | part of either panel. These respondents are coded as 
         | "99. MISSING" for IMD1007. For further information on the sample
         | composition, see Part 6 of the CSES MODULE 4 Codebook.

         | There are two sample components in the US data distinguishing
         | early voters (N=115) and voters who cast a ballot on election 
         | day. Respondents were asked in the pre-election survey whether
         | they had voted early. Respondents who affirmed this were still
         | asked the MODULE 4 questions about their voting behavior 
         | (D3005_PR_1 - D3006_UH_DC) in the post-election survey.

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD1008_MOD
         |
         | IMD1008_MOD_ are binary variables indicating the CSES Module
         | which was included in the respective election study. For 
         | example, respondents from an election study with questions from
         | MODULE 3 would be coded 1 for IMD1008_MOD_3, and 0 for all other
         | IMD1008_MOD_ variables.
         |
         | The Standalone CSES Modules were administered during the
         | following years (inclusive):
         |
         | CSES MODULE 1: 1996 - 2001 - SEE BELOW
         | CSES MODULE 2: 2001 - 2006
         | CSES MODULE 3: 2006 - 2011 - SEE BELOW
         | CSES MODULE 4: 2011 - 2016
         |
         | The official period covered in CSES MODULE 2 is from 1996 to 
         | 2001. However, the Portuguese election study of 2002 included 
         | both CSES MODULES 1 and 2 in their study. For more see ELECTION 
         | STUDY NOTE for Portugal below. 
         |         
         | The official period covered in CSES MODULE 3 is from 2006 to 
         | 2011. The questionnaire was finalized for data collection 
         | beginning in 2006, however, there are three pilot studies from 
         | 2005 covering MODULE 3, namely Germany (2005), Norway (2005) and 
         | Poland (2005).
         |
         | The official period covered in CSES MODULE 4 is from 2011 to 
         | 2016. A preliminary questionnaire was used for pretests in 2011 -
         | this version of the questionnaire was very similar to the final
         | version. The questionnaire was finalized in 2012.
         |
         | These variables are original to CSES IMD, and therefore there are 
         | no corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PORTUGAL (2002): IMD1008_MOD_
         |
         | The Portuguese 2002 election study was administered during the 
         | transition phase between CSES MODULES 1 and 2. Therefore, it 
         | covered both the MODULE 1 and the MODULE 2 questionnaire. 
         | Respondents from the 2002 Portuguese study are thus coded
         | 1 in both IMD1008_MOD_1 and IMD1008_MOD_2.

         | The 2001 Belarusian lower house election took place on March 18,
         | 2000. The presidential election was held on September 9, 2001. 
         | The original election study primarily refers to the presidential
         | election. However, leader evaluations, party evaluations, and 
         | macro data refer to the legislative election.

         |
         | Variables referring to the presidential election in CSES IMD
         | refer to the direct elections in 1996 for the Israeli Prime 
         | Ministership. During the 1992-1996 parliamentary session, the 
         | Knesset decided to introduce a system of direct election for 
         | the prime ministership. The move followed the so-called 
         | "Dirty Trick" scandal of 1990 when Shimon Peres, then leader of 
         | the Labor party (Alignment), attempted to form a minority 
         | government made up of left-wing factions and ultra-orthodox 
         | parties, at the expense of the national unity government formed 
         | in 1988 and led by Likud's Yitzhak Shamir. While the national
         | unity government became the first government in the history of 
         | Israel to be dismissed by a parliamentary motion of
         | no-confidence, Peres was unable to form a government and 
         | Yitzak Shamir continued as prime minister, now leading a 
         | right-wing coalition government excluding Labor. During the 
         | attempts to form a Labor-led government, potential coalition 
         | members publicly demanded financial inducements for their 
         | support, prompting discussions of electoral reform. The direct 
         | election for the prime ministership continued in the 1999 and 
         | 2001 elections but was abandoned afterwards.

          Election Study Weights to compensate for a type of design effect
         ..................................................................
         
         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD1010_
         |
         | These variables contain the "Polity Weights" of the Standalone 
         | CSES Modules, originally provided as variables A1012_, B1012_,
         | C1012_, and D1012_.They report standardized versions (with a
         | mean 1 within the polity) of the original weights provided with
         | the component election studies. They are the ratio of each
         | weighting factor to the mean weight of each type, calculated
         | within each polity.
         |
         | The derivative "Election Study Weights" (IMD1010_) have been
         | created so that for each weight (sample, demographic, political),
         | each respondent within the election study has a mean weight 
         | of "1". If you are running a frequency, for instance, this weight
         | will work so that the N in your frequency table comes out to
         | approximately the same as the number of interviews in the
         | study. This derivative weight is created by dividing the
         | individual weight for each respondent within an election
         | study by the mean for that weight for all respondents in that
         | election study.
         |
         | The STATA code used to create the derivative variables in the
         | CSES dataset is available in the original documentation of 
         | weighting variables, available in Codebook Parts 2 of the 
         | Standalone CSES Modules. 
         |
         | Use of weights is at the discretion of the analyst based upon
         | the considerations of her/his individual research question.
         | We recommend that analysts familiarize themselves with the
         | weights, their components, and their methods of creation
         | before applying them. For IMD1010_, users are advised to pay
         | special attention to the documentation of the original weights
         | provided by collaborators (A1010_, B1010_, C1010_, D1010_) and 
         | the factor variables reporting the mean weight of each type
         | (A1011_, B1011_, C1011_, D1011_), available in Codebook Parts 2
         | of the CSES MODULES.
         |
         | Additionally, analysts will want to keep in mind that these
         | weights are prepared to be election study weights, not country
         | weights. To convert the weights to country weights requires an
         | adjustment for those countries for which one or more polities
         | or election studies appear in the dataset.
         |
         | In the table below, we give an overview about what types of 
         | weights were originally provided by collaborators. More 
         | information on these weights is available in the Codebook Parts 2
         | of the CSES MODULES and in the design reports provided by 
         | collaborators.
         | In cases where a collaborator provides a single weight that
         | is a combination of one or more of the three weight categories
         | (sample, demographic, and political), the weight is duplicated
         | in the two or more appropriate variables. Thus, analysts using
         | two or more of the weights simultaneously will need to account
         | for this duplication.
         | Where a weight of a particular type is unavailable, these
         | variables are coded 1.

         | Sample weights include those intended to correct for unequal
         | selection probabilities resulting from "booster" samples,
         | procedures for selection within the household, non-response,
         | as well as other features of the sample design.
         |
         | Demographic weights adjust sample distributions of socio-
         | demographic characteristics to more closely resemble the
         | characteristics of the population.
         |
         | Political weights reconcile discrepancies in the reported
         | electoral behavior of the survey respondents from the
         | official vote counts.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BELGIUM-WALLONIA (1999): IMD1010_3

         | For 447 respondents, the weight is set to zero. This is the 
         | result of missing data which was used to calculate the original
         | weight. Because the assignment of zero was a collaborator 
         | decision and the weights appear this way in the original data
         | deposits, no change was made.

         | 49 respondents who were younger than 18 and ineligible to vote
         | at the time of the election. The originally deposited 
         | demographic weight was calculated based on the full sample, 
         | including those respondents who were ineligible to vote.  

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NETHERLANDS (1998): IMD1010_2, IMD1010_3
         |
         | For 287 respondents, the weight is set to zero. This is the 
         | result of missing data which was used to calculate the original
         | weight. Because the assignment of zero was a collaborator 
         | decision and the weights appear this way in the original data
         | deposits, no change was made.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PERU (2011): IMD1010_3
         | 
         | Because of compulsory voting in Peru, non-voters are coded as
         | zero in IMD1010_3 and are thus excluded from any analysis, 
         | when the weight is applied.  

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PERU (2016): IMD1010_1-IMD1010_3
         |
         | Political weights were not constructed for 123 respondents in 
         | CSES Module 4. 105 of these respondents did not cast a vote in 
         | the presidential elections (IMD3001_PR_1) and the remaining 18
         | respondents did not specify their vote choice in 
         | the presidential elections (IMD3002_PR_1). These cases were 
         | set to zero for the political weight variable and thus, are
         | dropped from analyses if IMD1010_3 is applied.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PORTUGAL (2005): IMD1010_2
         |
         | The demographic weight was constructed on the basis of Census
         | 2001 information about the distribution of 18+ years of age
         | residents in Continental Portugal on the basis of sex (2
         | strata), age (3 strata), and education (3 strata).
         |
         | The demographic weight was initially deposited with 215 cases
         | having missing data. In the CSES data file, these cases are
         | coded "0."  These are cases for which at least one relevant
         | demographic variable was missing for the respondent. The
         | collaborator preferred to assign a weight of "0" to these cases
         | given that the demographic information was not complete for the
         | case.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PORTUGAL (2005): IMD1010_3
         |
         | The political weight was constructed on the basis of the 2005
         | election results in order to weigh the results of the vote
         | recall question.
         |
         | The political weight was originally deposited with 428 cases
         | having missing data. In the CSES data file, these cases are
         | coded "0."  These are cases for which at least one relevant
         | political variable was missing for the respondent. The
         | collaborator preferred to assign a weight of "0" to these
         | cases given that the political information was not complete
         | for the case.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SPAIN (2000): IMD1010_2
         |
         | For one respondent, the weight is set to zero. This is the 
         | result of missing data which was used to calculate the original
         | weight. Because the assignment of zero was a collaborator 
         | decision and the weights appear this way in the original data

         | Following CSES conventions, the scale for IMD2003 is 
         | based on the highest educational attainment, rather than on 
         | enrollment in an educational program. For example, only

         | In CSES MODULE 4, the ISCED scheme was introduced to measure
         | educational attainment, which included two categories for 
         | secondary education, lower and upper. Respondents coded as 
         | "03. ISCED LEVEL 2 - LOWER SECONDARY" were coded into CSES IMD
         | code "02. PRIMARY EDUCATION/LOWER SECONDARY EDUCATION" to ensure
         | consistency with other CSES Modules in which the category 
         | "SECONDARY COMPLETED" referred to respondents who had attained
         | the minimum level of qualifications normally required for entry
         | into university or other degree-level higher education. 
         | According to the ISCED coding scheme, only the completion of
         | an upper secondary educational program would allow for someone
         | to enter a degree program. Hence, the two secondary education

         |
         | This variable is an optional variable in the CSES.
         | As a result, it was not carried in all of the studies.
         | In some studies, this item was included but with different
         | response categories. For more information on these diverging 
         | response categories, see Election Study Notes, available in

         | MODULE 3: C2023
         | MODULE 4: D2024
         |
         | Because the CSES questionnaires of origin do not include
         | filter instructions in the demographic section, IMD2005_1 was 
         | asked irrespectively of individuals' religious denomination.

         |
         | Researchers are advised that Australian respondents stating to
         | attend church "less than once a year" are coded as never 
         | attending religious services (code 1) in 2013. 
         | This differs from earlier Australian studies, which code such
         | such respondents as attending services once a year (code 2). 
  
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES – GREAT BRITAIN (1997): IMD2005_1
         |
         | In the British 1997 Election Study, respondents who neither named 
         | a religious denomination, nor a religion in which they were 
         | brought up were not asked about their religious service 
         | attendance. These respondents are coded "1. Never" in CSES
         | MODULE 1. This coding remains unchanged for the IMD. 
         | Further, researchers are advised that British respondents 
         | stating to attend church "less often than once a year" or 
         | "varies too much to say" are coded "2. Once a year" in 1997. 
         | This differs from later British Election Studies, which code 
         | such respondents as never attending religious services (code 1).

         | Income ranges shown represent sample quintiles (not population

         | between contiguous sets of ranges.
         |
         | Where deposited income data were not grouped into sample 
         | quintiles, the data have been re-coded into quintiles, according
         | to sample proportions (not national statistics). For cases where
         | it was not possible to compute sample quintiles, the income 
         | categories approximating sample quintiles the closest have been
         | used. Consequently, this variable may contain distributions that
         | do not really represent quintiles.

         | ended question first asked respondents to report their income. 
         | Those that did not respond were then asked if their income 
         | fitted into one of seven income ranges that the interviewer 
         | provided them with. Quintiles were created based on the 
         | open-ended question. Four of the seven ranges in the second 
         | income question fit the distribution of the quintiles and 
         | were added to the variable. Respondents in the remaining 
         | three categories were coded as missing.

         | (1) Respondents were asked what their household income was and
         | if they gave the raw figure, it was recorded; and (2) if they
         | were reluctant, respondents were given the option of identifying
         | the broad categories into which their household income fits

         | The data provided does not reflect true quintiles derived from
         | continuous data. The national collaborators asked people about
         | their income using a 5 point scale. The ranges were designed to

         | in Japan. However, responses were underrepresented in the
         | sample of the lowest income category because income is a very
         | sensitive issue in Japan.

         | Note that the coding of IMD2006 does not follow the CSES manner 
         | for Thailand (2007). The variable includes a category for no 
         | income and only four additional categories on the actual income 
         | of respondents. Moreover, the distribution of the data does not
         | reflect income quintiles.

         | income of married respondents. Incomes for the remaining 
         | respondents base on the complete household, as long as all other
         | household members were under age 18, or on the respondents'
         | income, exclusively.

         | Instead of using the CSES-schema, some countries employ the
         | amount of inhabitants for the size of respondents' place of
         | residence. These measurements do not fit the categories
         | generally used for IMD2007. Consequently, we advise users to
         | carefully read the ELECTION STUDY NOTES of the current variable, 
         | which are available in Part 2 of the Codebooks for the respective
         | CSES Modules.

IMD2008       >>> REGION OF RESIDENCE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         This variable reports the respondent's region of residence.
         Regions are usually (but not always) based upon the social,
         cultural, or historical differences (though some correspond
         to administrative regions) that manifest themselves in
         political cleavages. 
         Codes are listed in alphabetical order of polity.

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD2008
         |
         | In CSES IMD, each region receives a unique numerical identifier
         | that is consistent across modules. This six-digit numerical
         | identifier contains information on the polity and a unique 
         | numerical value to distinguish the region. 
         |
         | The first three digits of the identifier consist of the 
         | numerical codes ranging from 001 to 999, with each region  
         | assigned a value that remains consistent across Modules. The  
         | remaining three digits consist of the three-digit UN Polity 
         | Identifier Code.
         | In assigning of the first three digits, regions in most polities
         | were assigned numbers randomly beginning with "001". In cases
         | where this practice deviates, it is detailed in POLITY NOTES.
         | 
         | Users are advised to consult CSES Standalone Module Codebooks
         | for more details on how region is classified in Standalone 
         | Modules.  
         | In some polities, the region of residence variable was collected  
         | differently in the same polity across time. As the region of    
         | residence variable in CSES IMD is harmonized, some aggregation 
         | of data has been applied. Details of specific aggregations are 
         | listed in POLITY NOTES. 
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: A2019        
         | MODULE 2: B2027

         | [POLITY NOTES] – MEXICO: IMD2010
         |
         | All Mexican studies included in the CSES Standalone Modules 
         | employed the same scale for measuring race or ethnicity, 
         | distinguishing between Whites, Indigenous Peoples, Mestizos and
         | other groups. 
         | However, while the Standalone CSES MODULES 1 and 2 coded data 
         | for Mexico 1997, 2000, and 2003 into ethnicity, later CSES

         | [POLITY NOTES] – PERU: IMD2010
         |
         | The Peruvian 2011 and 2016 studies distinguish between four
         | ethnic groups, namely: Indigenous people, Afro Peruvians, 
         | Whites and Mestizos. As these groups match the IMD coding scheme
         | for respondents' race, the Peruvian data is coded into IMD2010, 
         | while IMD2011 (Ethnicity) has been recoded to missing. 
         | The following table lists how the original categories employed 
         | in the respective Peruvian studies were coded in CSES IMD:

         | [POLITY NOTES] – UNITED STATES: IMD2010
         |
         | The U.S. 1996 study does not differentiate between Asians and 
         | Pacific Islanders. Hence, the category "02. ASIAN" includes
         | respondents of either origin. Researchers are advised that 
         | respondent's race (IMD2010) was assessed by the interviewer, 
         | while ethnic identity (IMD2011) was reported by the respondent.
         | Further, the U.S. 2004, 2008 and 2012 studies included separate
         | categories for Latinos and Hispanics. Respondents classified as
         | either Latino or Hispanic were recoded to 96. OTHER in the IMD.

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] – CANADA (2008): IMD2010
         |
         | The race variable for the Canadian 2008 election study 
         | distinguishes respondents from racial minorities from other 
         | respondents in the sample. As this approach is challenging
         | to translate to the IMD2010 coding scheme, data for Canada 
         | (2008) is set to missing in the IMD. 

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] – GREAT BRITAIN (1997 & 2005): IMD2010
         |
         | The British 1997 and 2005 election studies included both data
         | for respondents' race (IMD2010) and respondents' ethnicity 
         | (IMD2011). Harmonizing data for the CSES IMD revealed that 
         | the British 1997 and 2005 data for ethnicity were collapsed
         | into more general categories for coding race in the Standalone
         | CSES Modules. Therefore, the CSES IMD includes the respective 
         | data in IMD2010 (Race), while IMD2011 (Ethnicity) is coded 
         | missing. 
         | The following table lists how the original categories employed 
         | in the respective British studies were coded in CSES IMD:

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] – HUNGARY (1998): IMD2010
         |
         | The race variable for the Hungarian 1998 election study includes
         | data on interviewer's assessment of whether the respondent 
         | was Romani or not. 
         | As the Roma are an ethnic rather than racial group, the IMD 
         | includes the respective data in IMD2011 (Ethnicity), while
         | IMD2010 (Race) is coded missing.

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] – NEW ZEALAND (1996): IMD2010
         |
         | The New Zealand 1996 election study included both data for
         | respondents' race (IMD2010) and respondents' ethnicity (IMD2011).
         | Harmonizing data for the CSES IMD revealed that the New Zealand
         | 1996 data for ethnicity were collapsed into more general 
         | categories for coding race in CSES MODULE 1. 
         | As data included in the ethnicity variable was found to be more 
         | accurate and fine-grained, IMD2010 was set to missing for 
         | New Zealand (1996). 

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] – NEW ZEALAND (2008): IMD2010
         |
         | The 2008 New Zealand study differentiates between respondents 
         | of Maori and other origins. For the IMD, respondents of Maori
         | origin are coded as 5. INDIGENOUS, while the remaining 
         | respondents are coded as 96. OTHER.

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD2011
         |
         | In the Standalone CSES Modules, IMD2011 was coded according to 
         | national standards. For the CSES IMD, these individual scales 
         | were harmonized in accordance with the coding scheme outlined 
         | above.
         |
         | Coding conventions for IMD2011 are based on the European 
         | Standard Classification of Cultural and Ethnic Groups (ESCEG), 
         | developed by Anthony Heath and Silke Schneider for the 
         | European Social Survey (ESS). 
         |
         | The ESCEG Classification of respondents' ethnicity distinguishes
         | between the following levels of detail: 
         | - Broad groups (1st digit) 
         | - Narrow groups (2nd digit) 
         | - National / cross-border groups (3rd and 4th digit) 
         | - Sub-national groups (5th digit)
         |
         | Where deemed necessary, ESCEG was extended for CSES IMD to 
         | incorporate additional ethnic groups. 
         |
         | Further, users are advised that the scale above only lists 
         | ethnicities represented in the IMD dataset. An English-language 
         | description of the full ESCEG Classification can be found here:

         |
         | All Mexican studies included in the CSES Standalone Modules

         | distinguishing between Whites, Indigenous Peoples, Mestizos and
         | other groups. 
         | However, while the Standalone CSES MODULES 1 and 2 coded data 
         | for Mexico 1997, 2000, and 2003 into ethnicity, later CSES 
         | Modules coded data into race. The CSES IMD harmonizes coding
         | by including the available data into IMD2010 (Race). 
         | Consequentially, IMD2011 (Ethnicity) is coded missing for all

         | for respondents' race, the Peruvian data is coded into IMD2010 
         | (Race), while IMD2011 has been recoded to missing.

         | In the Standalone CSES MODULE 2, 80 percent of the Canadian 
         | (2004) data are coded missing. Therefore, IMD2011 has not been
         | harmonized for Canada (2004) but set to missing.

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] – GREAT BRITAIN (1997 & 2005): IMD2011
         |
         | The British 1997 and 2005 election studies included both data
         | for respondents' race (IMD2010) and respondents' ethnicity 
         | (IMD2011). Harmonizing data for the CSES IMD revealed that 
         | the British 1997 and 2005 data for ethnicity were collapsed
         | into more general categories for coding race in the Standalone
         | CSES Modules. Therefore, the CSES IMD includes the respective 
         | data in IMD2010 (Race), while IMD2011 (Ethnicity) is coded 
         | missing.

         | The British 2015 election study incorporates a coding scheme
         | combining racial and ethnic groups. Based on the advice by 
         | the authors of ESCEG, categories from the 2015 BES were 
         | classified as follows:

         | The Russian 1999 and 2000 election studies include respondents
         | from a variety of backgrounds, reflecting ethnic diversity in 
         | Russia. Whenever possible, respondents were coded into existing
         | categories. As many of the non-classifiable groups are just 
         | represented by one or two respondents, they were grouped into 
         | existing ESCEG categories as follows:

         |
         | The Swiss election studies do not include a survey question
         | about respondents' ethnicity. Data in CSES MODULES 1 and 2 from
         | the Swiss 1999 and 2003 election studies refer to the 
         | language in which the interview was conducted.
         | The original ESCEG coding scheme employed for coding IMD2011
         | foresees one single code for Swiss language regions, namely
         | 11101. SWISS LANGUAGE REGION NEC (Including Swiss-French, 
         | Swiss-German, Swiss-Italian, Romansch). 
         | However, to preserve information from the original data in the

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD2014
         |
         | Respondents who are temporarily unemployed are coded UNEMPLOYED.
         | Respondents on "workfare" or enrolled in a government job 
         | training program are coded EMPLOYED.
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: A2007
         | MODULE 2: B2010
         | MODULE 3: C2010
         | MODULE 4: D2010
         |
         | There is some inconsistency between studies in the way
         | the responses to the questions about current employment status
         | (IMD2014) affected the application of the follow-up occupation
         | variables (IMD2016-IMD2018). The CSES standard is that the
         | occupation variables are asked from those in labor force.
         | However, in some cases, for respondents categorized as not in
         | labor force in IMD2014 (codes 6-12) the occupation variables may
         | report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses
         | concerning occupation that belong to respondents not in labor
         | force presumably reflect their previous or last occupation.
         |
         | Some studies do not include information on the weekly working 
         | time. In studies distinguishing between "full time" and "part 
         | time" employment, respondents are coded as working full 
         | time or part-time, respectively, regardless of their actual 
         | weekly working time. Other studies group all employed spouses
         | into one general category. In these cases, respondents are coded 
         | as "00. EMPLOYED – NOT FURTHER SPECIFIED". 
         |
         | Data are unavailable for Brazil (2006), Denmark (2001) and 
         | Thailand (2001).  

         | [POLITY NOTES] – CANADA: IMD2014
         |
         | There is some inconsistency for the Canadian election studies
         | in how answer categories for respondent's employment status
         | were coded in the CSES Standalone Modules. 
         | Data have been harmonized for IMD where possible. However, some
         | of the inconsistencies remain, as it was not always possible to 
         | disentangle the respective codes from other groups for IMD.
         | The table below provides further information on the affected
         | answer categories:

         |
         | Self-employed respondents and respondents working at two or more
         | jobs were assigned election-study specific codes in the Canadian
         | 2008 study (MODULE 3), but were recoded to 1. EMPLOYED – FULL 
         | TIME in CSES IMD, in line with the other Canadian studies. 
         | Respondents who were retired and working for pay or caring for a
         | family and working for pay were assigned election-study specific 
         | codes in the Canadian 2011 and 2015 studies (MODULE 4). For the
         | IMD, the respective groups were coded to 2. EMPLOYED – PART-TIME
         | in line with the 2004 Canadian study. The same applies to 
         | working students, who used to be coded 3. EMPLOYED – LESS THAN 
         | PART TIME in 2011 and 2015. 

         | POLITY NOTES - GERMANY: IMD2014
         | 
         | In the German 1998, 2002 Telephone, and 2013 studies, code 
         | 10. OTHERS, NOT IN LABOR FORCE may refer to respondents either
         | on maternity/parental leave, within civil/military service,
         | engaged in a voluntary work program, or to other groups outside
         | of the labor force. Coding remains unchanged, as it was not 
         | possible to disentangle the respective groups for IMD.

         | As the Australian 2013 study was conducted as a mail self-

         | answers to IMD2014. In CSES MODULE 4, these cases were assigned
         | the code "11. See Election Study Notes". For the CSES IMD, they

         | Also see VARIABLE NOTES for IMD2015_ISCO_08 (Main Occupation, 
         | CSES MODULE 4) and IMD2014 (Current Employment Status).
         | 
         | The IMD2015_ISCO_ variables report the respondent's main 
         | occupation; that is, the job at which the respondent spends the 
         | most time or if the respondent spends an equal amount of time on 
         | two jobs, it is the one from which the respondent earns the most
         | money. For respondents who are currently employed, these
         | variables report their current occupation. For respondents who 
         | are retired or not currently working, these variables report 
         | respondent's last occupation.
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: A2008
         | MODULE 2: B2011
         | MODULE 3: C2011
         | MODULE 4: D2011, inc. in IMD2015_ISCO_08 (SEE VAR. NOTES BELOW)
         | 
         | Coding conventions for CSES MODULES 1-3 employ the first two
         | out of four digits of 1988 ISCO / ILO International Standard 
         | Classification of Occupations Code from the International 
         | Labor Organization, CH-1211, Geneva 22, Switzerland.
         |
         | As the 1988 ISCO Classification has been updated in 2008, 
         | CSES MODULE 4 employs this revised ISCO 08 Classification for
         | coding occupation. 
         | According to the ILO, 2008 updates to ISCO "imply a break in 
         | series between statistics … at all levels in the classification 
         | hierarchy" (ILO, 2008, p.22). CSES only makes use of the broader 
         | levels of the coding scheme, meaning that a multitude of
         | categories cannot be reclassified unambiguously. Hence, CSES IMD
         | provides ISCO 88 codes for CSES MODULES 1-3 and ISCO 08 codes
         | for CSES MODULE 4 in two separate variables.

         | 
         | The Latvian 2010 election study groups respondents' occupations  
         | into six broad categories, similar but not equal to the major
         | ISCO-88 groups. In CSES Module 3, "skilled workers" from the 
         | Latvian 2010 study were classified as "60. Skilled Agricultural  
         | and fisheries workers". However, as skilled workers might also
         | refer to additional groups like craft and related trade workers

         |
         | For some studies, IMD2016 is not based on a separate survey 
         | question, but derived from respondents' main occupation 
         | (IMD2015). Details on the applied recodes for IMD2016 are 
         | provided in ELECTION STUDY NOTES, available in Codebook Parts 2 
         | of the Standalone CSES Modules. 
         | 
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: Not included
         | MODULE 2: B2012
         | MODULE 3: C2012
         | MODULE 4: D2012
         |
         | The Standalone CSES MODULES 2-4 included two auxiliary codes
         | 5 and 6, for categories originally not envisaged by the CSES
         | coding scheme. For the CSES IMD, these codes have now been 
         | integrated into the above coding scheme whenever possible. 
         | The remaining codes were either set to 5. OTHER, with 
         | explanation given in ELECTION STUDY NOTES, or set to missing 
         | in cases they concerned respondents out of labor force 
         | (homemakers, full-time students, etc.). 
         | 
         | There is some inconsistency between studies in the way
         | the responses to the questions about current employment status
         | (IMD2014) affected the application of the follow-up occupation
         | variables (IMD2015-IMD2018). The CSES standard is that the
         | occupation variables are asked from those in labor force.
         | However, in some cases, for respondents categorized as not in
         | labor force in IMD2014 (codes 6-12) the occupation variables may
         | report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses
         | concerning occupation that belong to respondents not in labor
         | force presumably reflect their previous or last occupation.

         | The coding scheme for employment type applied in CSES IMD

         | In what follows, we list how the original categories employed in

         | There is some inconsistency among studies in the way
         | the responses to the questions about current employment status
         | (IMD2014) affected the application of the follow-up occupation
         | variables (IMD2016-IMD2018). The CSES standard is that the
         | occupation variables are asked from those in the labor force.
         | However, in some cases, for respondents categorized as not in
         | labor force in IMD2014 (codes 6-12) the occupation variables may
         | report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses
         | concerning occupation that belong to respondents not in labor
         | force presumably reflect their previous or last occupation.

         | There is some inconsistency among studies in the way
         | responses to the questions about current employment status
         | of spouses (IMD2020) were administered, affecting the 
         | application of the follow-up occupation variables (IMD2021-
         | IMD2024). The CSES standard is that the occupation variables are 
         | asked for those in the labor force. However, in some cases, 
         | for spouses categorized as not in the labor force in IMD2020 
         | (codes 6-12), the occupation variables may report their previous 
         | or last occupation.
         |
         | Some studies do not include information on the weekly working 
         | time. In studies distinguishing between "full time" and "part 
         | time" employment, spouses are coded as working full time or 
         | part-time, respectively, regardless of their actual weekly 
         | working time. Other studies group all employed spouses into one
         | general category. In these cases, respondents are coded as

         | Additionally, there is variation in the way the questions about 
         | respondent's spouse were administered in different election 
         | studies. In some cases, only those categorized as "married or 
         | living together" in IMD2004 were asked the spouse questions,
         | while in some surveys, other responses could also lead to a
         | respondent being asked these questions. Consequently, IMD2020
         | sometimes includes information of spouses from respondents
         | who reported neither being married nor living together with a
         | partner (IMD2004 is not coded 1.). These data remain unchanged.

         | Occupation, CSES MODULE 4) and IMD2020 (Spouse: Current 
         | Employment Status).
         |
         | The IMD2021_ISCO_ variables report the respondent's spouse's 
         | main occupation; that is, the job at which the respondent's 
         | spouse spends the most time, or if the respondent's spouse
         | spends an equal amount of time on two jobs, it is the one from 
         | which the respondent's spouse earns the most money. 
         | For spouses who are currently employed, these variables report 
         | their current occupation. For spouses who are retired or not 
         | currently working, these variables report the spouse's last
         | occupation.
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: A2011
         | MODULE 2: B2016
         | MODULE 3: C2016
         | MODULE 4: D2016, included in IMD2015_ISCO_08 (See below)
         |
         | Coding conventions for CSES MODULES 1-3 employ the first two
         | out of four digits of 1988 ISCO / ILO International Standard 
         | Classification of Occupations Code from the International 
         | Labor Organization, CH-1211, Geneva 22, Switzerland.
         |
         | As the 1988 ISCO Classification has been updated in 2008, 
         | CSES MODULE 4 employs this revised ISCO08 Classification for
         | coding occupation. 
         | According to the ILO, 2008 updates to ISCO "imply a break in 
         | series between statistics … at all levels in the classification 
         | hierarchy" (ILO, 2008, p.22). CSES only makes use of the broader 
         | levels of the coding scheme, meaning that a multitude of
         | categories cannot be reclassified unambiguously. Hence, CSES IMD
         | provides ISCO88 codes for CSES MODULES 1-3 and ISCO-08 codes
         | for CSES MODULE 4 in two separate variables.

         | There is variation in how the questions about the respondent's
         | spouse were administered in different election studies.
         | In some cases, only those categorized as "married or living
         | together" in IMD2004 were asked the spouse questions, while in
         | some surveys other responses could also lead to a respondent
         | being asked these questions. Consequently, IMD2021_ISCO_

         | Occupation, CSES MODULES 1-3) and IMD2020 (Spouse: Current 
         | Employment Status).
         |
         | The IMD2021_ISCO_ variables report the respondent's spouse's 
         | main occupation; that is, the job at which the respondent's 
         | spouse spends the most time, or if the respondent's spouse
         | spends an equal amount of time on two jobs, it is the one from 
         | which the respondent's spouse earns the most money. 
         | For spouses who are currently employed, these variables report 
         | their current occupation. For spouses who are retired or not 
         | currently working, these variables report the spouse's last
         | occupation.
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: A2011, inc. in IMD2015_ISCO_88 (SEE VAR. NOTES BELOW)
         | MODULE 2: B2016, inc. in IMD2015_ISCO_88 (SEE VAR. NOTES BELOW)
         | MODULE 3: C2016, inc. in IMD2015_ISCO_88 (SEE VAR. NOTES BELOW)
         | MODULE 4: D2016
         |
         | Coding conventions for CSES MODULE 4 employ the first two
         | out of four digits of 2008 ISCO / ILO International Standard 
         | Classification of Occupations Code from the International 
         | Labor Organization, CH-1211, Geneva 22, Switzerland.
         |
         | In the earlier CSES MODULES 1-3, occupation codes were based on
         | the first two digits of the 1988 ISCO Classification. 
         | According to the ILO, 2008 updates to ISCO "imply a break in 
         | series between statistics … at all levels in the classification 
         | hierarchy" (ILO, 2008, p.22). CSES only makes use of the broader 
         | levels of the coding scheme, meaning that a multitude of
         | categories cannot be reclassified unambiguously. Hence, CSES IMD
         | provides ISCO88 codes for CSES MODULES 1-3 and ISCO-08 codes
         | for CSES MODULE 4 in two separate variables.

         | In some cases, it has not been possible to strictly adhere to 
         | the two-digit ISCO/ILO conventions. Users will find that some 
         | categories have been added to the ISCO/ILO list to accommodate
         | the occupations of respondents who were not easily classified.
         | These include categories referring to the first digit of the 
         | 2008 ISCO / ILO occupations code. In these cases, zeros
         | were added to preserve the two-digit structure (e.g.,

         | meaning of the additional codes, available in Codebook Parts 2

         | There is variation in how the questions about the respondent's
         | spouse were administered in different election studies.
         | In some cases, only those categorized as "married or living
         | together" in IMD2004 were asked the spouse questions, while in
         | some surveys other responses could also lead to a respondent
         | being asked these questions. Consequently, IMD2021_ISCO_ 
         | sometimes include information of spouses from respondents who
         | reported neither being married nor living together with a 
         | partner (IMD2004 is not coded 1.). These data remain unchanged.

         |
         | 4. Self-Employed:
         | Self-employed occupations of all kinds, excluding self-employed
         | farming. Included, for example, entrepreneurs, shopkeeper,
         | professionals, such as lawyers, medical doctors etc.
         |
         | For some studies, IMD2022 is not based on a separate survey 
         | question, but derived from spouses' main occupation (IMD2021).
         | Details on the applied recodes for IMD2022 are provided in
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES, available in Codebook Parts 2 of the 
         | Standalone CSES Modules.
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: Not included
         | MODULE 2: B2017
         | MODULE 3: C2017
         | MODULE 4: D2017
         |
         | The Standalone CSES MODULES 2-4 included two auxiliary codes
         | 5 and 6, for categories originally not envisaged by the CSES
         | coding scheme. For the CSES IMD, these codes have now been 
         | integrated into the above coding scheme whenever possible. 
         | The remaining codes were either set to 5. OTHER, with 
         | explanation given in ELECTION STUDY NOTES, or set to missing 
         | in cases they concerned respondents out of labor force 
         | (homemakers, full-time students, etc.).
         |
         | There is some inconsistency among studies in the way the 
         | responses to the questions about current the employment status of 
         | spouses (IMD2020) affected the application of the follow-up
         | occupation variables (IMD2021-IMD2024). The CSES standard
         | is that the occupation variables are asked from those in the 
         | labor force. However, in some cases, for spouses categorized as
         | not in labor force in IMD2020 (codes 6-12), the occupation 
         | variables may report a spouse's last occupation. Hence, the 
         | responses concerning occupation that belong to respondents with
         | spouses not in labor force presumably reflect their previous or 
         | last occupation.

         | Moreover, there is variation in the ways in which the questions

         | election studies. In some cases, only those categorized as
         | "married or living together" in IMD2004 were asked the spouse
         | questions, while in some surveys other responses could also lead
         | to a respondent being asked these questions. Consequently IMD2022
         | sometimes includes information of spouses from respondents who
         | reported neither being married nor living together with a
         | partner (IMD2004 is not code 1). These data remained unchanged.

         | There is some inconsistency among studies in the way the
         | responses to the questions about the current employment status of
         | spouses (IMD2020) affected the application of the follow-up
         | occupation variables (IMD2021-IMD2024). The CSES standard is that
         | the occupation variables are asked from those in the labor force.
         | However, in some cases, for spouses categorized as not in labor
         | force in IMD2020 (codes 6-12), the occupation variables may
         | report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses
         | concerning occupation that belong to respondents with spouses 
         | not in labor force presumably reflect their previous or last 
         | occupation.

         | Moreover, there is variation in the ways in which the questions
         | about respondent's spouse were administered in different
         | election studies. In some cases, only those categorized as
         | "married or living together" in IMD2004 were asked the spouse
         | questions, while in some surveys other responses could also lead
         | to a respondent being asked these questions. Consequently IMD2024
         | sometimes includes information of spouses from respondents who
         | reported neither being married nor living together with a
         | partner (IMD2004 is not code 1.). These data remained unchanged.

         This item ascertains whether or not the respondent cast a ballot
         in the main election, regardless of whether or not it was valid.
         In case of a single election taking place, e.g., a lower house
         election only, then this variable reports the turnout decision for
         that particular election. In cases where multiple elections took 
         place, e.g., a presidential and a lower house election, this
         variable reports the turnout decision in the main election. 
         See variable notes for more information.

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD3001_TS
         |
         | DERIVATIVE VARIABLE
         | This variable is constructed based on the respondent's reported
         | turnout in the current and previous main election.
         | In polities where multiple elections took place simultaneously,
         | this variable reports the turnout decision in the main election.
         | The classification of the main election by election study are
         | listed in the variable notes for variable IMD3001.
         |
         | In instances when the previous turnout refers to a different type 
         | of election, e.g., current main elections are presidential but
         | previous turnout variable refers to lower house election only,
         | these studies are set to missing for the IMD3001_TS variable.
         |
         | The data has been included in CSES IMD in the way it was
         | published in Standalone Modules. 
         | In some election studies, the previous turnout variable was not
         | asked directly in a survey, but generated from previous vote 
         | choice, under the assumption that all respondents reporting vote 
         | choice had voted. In other instances, the previous turnout 
         | variable was not constructed even when previous vote choice was
         | available. In this latter case, these studies are classified as 
         | "9. MISSING" for variable IMD3001_TS. 
         |
         | This variable is original to CSES IMD, and therefore there are 
         | no corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules.
         |
         | Data are unavailable for all studies in CSES MODULE 1 as previous
         | turnout was not asked. Data are also unavailable for AUSTRALIA 
         | (2007), AUSTRIA (2008), DENMARK (2001), FRANCE (2007), ITALY

         If applicable and respondent cast a ballot in the presidential
         election:

         These variables report the respondent's vote choice for
         President in the first and/or second round of election.

         If the data collection occurs between rounds in a two-round
         election, this item should report the respondent's vote choice
         intention for president in the second round.
         If the data collection occurs after the second round in a
         two-round election, this item should report the respondent's
         vote choice for president in the second round.

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |  
         | DERIVATIVE VARIABLE
         |         
         | This variable is constructed based on the respondent's reported
         | vote choice in the current and previous main election.
         | In polities where multiple elections took place simultaneously,
         | this variable reports the vote switching behavior in the main 
         | election. The classification of the main election by election 
         | study is listed in the VARIABLE NOTES Table below. 
         |
         | In case of a single election taking place, e.g., a lower house
         | election only, this variable reports the voting decision for
         | that particular election. 
         |         
         | In case of a presidential election, the variable refers to the 
         | incumbent president and/or the incumbent president's party. In 
         | all other cases, the variable refers to the party/parties which 
         | was/were part of the outgoing cabinet. 
         |
         | In mixed electoral systems where voters have a list vote and a 
         | district candidate vote, the list vote was used to determine if 
         | the respondent voted for the outgoing government or not.
         |
         | In case of a caretaker government, the party affiliation of its 
         | members was used to code this variable. Cabinet members without
         | a formal party affiliation were not considered for this variable.
         |
         | For election studies included in CSES MODULES 1 and 2, the coding
         | was based on a variety of sources. For CSES MODULES 3 and 4, the 
         | information in the macro variables about the party of the 
         | incumbent president and the cabinet membership was used.

         | * = Incumbent not identified - see ELECTION STUDY NOTES below
         |
         | The incumbent could not be identified for BELARUS (2008),
         | CHILE (1999, 2009), GREECE (2012), HONG KONG (1998, 2000, 2004,

         | SWITZERLAND (1999, 2003, 2007, 2011), and THAILAND (2007). 
         | Those election studies are coded as "9999996. NOT ASCERTAINED/ 
         | INCUMBENT CANDIDATE/PARTY DID NOT CONTEST". Further explanations      
         | are provided in the POLITY NOTES and ELECTION STUDY NOTES below. 
         |
         | This variable is original to CSES IMD, and therefore there are 
         | no corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules.
         |
         | Data are unavailable for THAILAND (2001).

         | POLITY NOTES – HONG KONG: IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The Chief Executive (CE) in Hong Kong is the highest government 
         | official, but they do not belong to any political party. Hence, 
         | IMD3002_OUTGOV was coded as "9999996. NOT ASCERTAINED/INCUMBENT  
         | CANDIDATE/PARTY DID NOT CONTEST."

         | POLITY NOTES – SWITZERLAND: IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The Federal Council of Switzerland functions as the collective 
         | executive in Switzerland. Because the Federal President rotates
         | among its members from each of the parties on a fixed, annual 
         | basis, no incumbent was coded. 

         | POLITY NOTES – SOUTH KOREA: IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | For all South Korean Studies in the CSES IMD, IMD3002_OUTGOV is 
         | coded based on the party affiliation of the incumbent President
         | at the time of the respective election. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BELARUS (2008): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The incumbent president at the time of the election, Alexander 
         | Lukashenko, was not a member officially of any party. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CHILE (1999): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The incumbent president at that time, Tagle, was a member of the 
         | Christian Democratic Party. He was elected in 1993 with the 
         | support of the alliance, Concertation, which the Christian 
         | Democracy Party was a member of. In the 1999 election, however, 
         | the Concertation alliance supported Ricardo Lagos from the Party 
         | for Democracy. Because the numerical party codes in CSES MODULE 
         | 1 referred to the individual parties and not the alliance, 
         | respondents were coded as "9999996. NOT ASCERTAINED/INCUMBENT
         | CANDIDATE/PARTY DID NOT CONTEST." 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CHILE (2005): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The incumbent president at the time of the 2005 Chilean 
         | Presidential Election, Ricardo Lagos, was a member of the Party 
         | for Democracy. He was elected in 2000 with the support of the 
         | alliance Concertation, of which the Party for Democracy was a 
         | member. In the 2005 Presidential election, however, the 
         | Concertation alliance supported Michelle Bachelet from the 
         | Socialist Party of Chile. Because the numerical party codes for
         | vote choice in the 2005 Chilean Presidential Election 
         | (IMD3002_PR_1) refer to the individual parties and not the 
         | alliance, voters who stated to have voted for the Socialist Party
         | in IMD3002_PR_1 were coded as having voted for the party of the 
         | incumbent.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CHILE (2009): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The incumbent president, Michelle Bachelet (Socialist Party), 
         | did not stand for election in the 2009 Chilean presidential 
         | elections. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CZECH REPUBLIC (2013): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | Prior to the election, the Czech Republic was governed by a 
         | caretaker government led by Jiri Rusnok. 14 of the 15 cabinet
         | members had no formal party membership. Thus, only respondents 
         | who voted for the Christian Democratic Union - Czech People's
         | Party (KDU-CSL), the party of the 15th cabinet member, were 
         | coded as "1. VOTED FOR THE OUTGOING GOVERNMENT" here. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GREECE (2012): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The government at the time of the election was a caretaker 
         | government (May 6, 2012, to June 17, 2012). All of its members 
         | were independents. Hence, IMD3002_OUTGOV was coded as "9999996.
         | NOT ASCERTAINED/INCUMBENT CANDIDATE/PARTY DID NOT CONTEST."

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES – ISRAEL (1996): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | 20 respondents were coded as not applicable for the lower house
         | vote choice variable in MODULE 1, A2030. These respondents are
         | coded as missing here. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - JAPAN (2013): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | Because the 2013 Japanese election study in MODULE 4 referred to
         | the upper house elections, the incumbent variable was coded on
         | the basis of the lower house and the Abe government.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES – KENYA (2013): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The incumbent Mwai Kibaki (Party of National Unity, PNU) did not 
         | contest in the 2013 presidential elections because of term 
         | limitations which permitted him to run for a third term. Also
         | the PNU did not field a candidate of its own in 2013.
       
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES – KYRGYZSTAN (2005): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The presidential office was held by the interim Kurmanbek
         | Bakiev, who had taken over the office three and a half months
         | prior to the election after then-President Akayev fled the 
         | country because of protests. Hence, IMD3002_OUTGOV was coded as 
         | "9999996. NOT ASCERTAINED/INCUMBENT CANDIDATE/PARTY DID NOT 
         | CONTEST."

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES – LITHUANIA (1997): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The incumbent president Algirdas Brazauskas (Democratic Labour
         | Party of Lithuania, LDDP) did not contest for another term and
         | his party, the LDDP, did not field or support another candidate.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES – PERU (2001): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The party of the incumbent president, Alberto Fujimori, Cambio 
         | 90 did not field a candidate in the 2001 presidential elections. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES – PERU (2006): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The party of the incumbent president Alejandro Toledo (Possible 
         | Peru) nominated Rafael Aubry for the 2006 elections. Three 
         | months before the elections, however, Aubry withdrew his 
         | candidacy. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES – PERU (2016): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The alliance Peru Wins, which had supported the incumbent, 
         | Ollanta Humala, did not field a candidate in the 2016 elections.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES – PHILIPPINES (2004): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | IMD3002_OUTGOV is coded based on the party affiliation of  
         | Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (LAKAS-CMD), the incumbent President at  
         | the time of the 2004 Philippine Presidential election. Arroyo 
         | originally got elected as the Vice President in the 1998 
         | Presidential election on a separate ticket, but became President
         | of the Philippines in 2001, after an impeachment of then 
         | President Joseph Estrada. Arroyo ran for re-election in 2004
         | and won the election.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES – ROMANIA (1996): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The lower house election was chosen as the main election for 
         | 1996 because the data for the presidential election in MODULE 1
         | refers to the second round. Hence, the incumbent party here was
         | the party of the then Prime Minister, Nicolae Vacaroiu (Romanian
         | Party of Social Democracy, PSD, which was known then as the Party
         | of Social Democracy in Romania, PDSR).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES – ROMANIA (2014): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | While the incumbent President Basescu technically ran on a 
         | Democrat Liberal Party (PDL) ticket in 2009, Romanian presidents 
         | cannot be legally a member of a party. According to the macro 
         | report from MODULE 4, Basescu was also closer to the People's 
         | Movement Party (PMP) during the second half of his term. Hence,

         |
         | DERIVATIVE VARIABLE
         |         
         | This variable is constructed based on the respondent's reported
         | vote choice in the current and previous main election.
         | In polities where multiple elections took place simultaneously,
         | this variable reports the vote switching behavior in the main 
         | election. The classifications of the main elections by election 
         | study are listed in the VARIABLE NOTES for variable 
         | IMD3002_OUTGOV.
         |
         | Respondents are classified as "0. DID NOT SWITCH" when they
         | expressed vote choice for the same party/coalition in the current
         | and previous election. In instances when a coalition is
         | competing in the current or previous election, and the parties
         | that comprise that coalition are competing individually in the
         | previous/current election, respondents who report voting for
         | the coalition and/or one of the parties comprising the coalition
         | are classified as "0. DID NOT SWITCH." Details of these cases
         | are specified in ELECTION STUDY NOTES below. 
         | Respondents are classified as "1. SWITCHER" when their reported
         | vote in the current election differs from their reported vote 
         | in the previous election. Further, respondents are classified as
         | "1. SWITCHER" when they report voting in one election (current
         | or previous) for a party/coalition that did not exist or
         | contest in the other (current or previous) election.
         |
         | Respondents are classified to "9. MISSING" when data about
         | their vote choice in the current and/or previous election is
         | unavailable, if they report that they don't know who they
         | voted for, or if they refused to answer the question. 
         | Additionally, respondents who report voting for an independent  
         | candidate or other parties without further specification are 
         | classified as "9. MISSING."
         | In instances where current and previous vote choice refer to 
         | different types of elections, e.g., a current main election is
         | presidential but previous vote choice refers to the lower
         | house election only, these studies are set to "9. MISSING".

         | This variable is original to CSES IMD, and therefore there are 
         | no corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules.

         This item classifies whether or not the respondent reports voting
         for a leftist / center / rightist party/candidate of the party.
         The classification is based on CSES Collaborators experts' 
         judgment of parties' ideology and the respondents' reported vote 
         choice.

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD3002_LR_CSES
         |
         | DERIVATIVE VARIABLE
         |
         | This variable is available for voters who reported voting for a 
         | party where expert judgments are available (i.e., for parties 
         | receiving an alphabetical classification by CSES). For more 
         | details on which parties/coalitions receive alphabetical 
         | classification, see "CSES IMD ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION 
         | CODING - RELATIONAL DATA" in CSES IMD Codebook Part 2. 
         |
         | This variable differentiates voters based on expert judgments
         | of the CSES Collaborators on the left-right ideology scale. 
         | Collaborators assign parties scores on an 11-point scale ranging
         | from "0. LEFT" to "10. RIGHT" for all parties assigned an 
         | alphabetical code by CSES. The expert judgment data by party 
         | is available in variable IMD5012_.  
         |
         | For IMD3100_LR_CSES, CSES linked the CSES Collaborator expert 
         | judgment with the reported vote choice of the respondent in the 
         | main election. A respondent who reports voting for a party/
         | candidate of PARTY A is assigned the value the CSES Collaborator 
         | gave to PARTY A in the said election on the left-right scale 
         | (and so on for PARTY B, PARTY C etc...). CSES reports these 
         | values in variable IMD3100_LR_CSES.          
         |
         | These scores provided in IMD3100_LR_CSES have then been 
         | re-classified for IMD3002_LR_CSES to establish whether a 
         | respondent voted for a leftist, centre or rightist party/
         | candidate. Scores assigned by collaborators are recoded into a 
         | trichotomy as follows: 
         |
         |        IMD3002_LR_CSES         CSES Collaborators Rating

         | 
         | In polities where multiple elections took place simultaneously, 
         | this variable reports the vote choice in the main election. The 
         | classifications of the main elections by election study are 
         | listed in the variable notes for variable IMD3002_OUTGOV.
         |
         | In this variable, the original L-R classifications assigned by
         | CSES Collaborators (available in IMD3100_LR_CSES and IMD5012) are
         | transformed into a three-category variable. Meanwhile, the L-R
         | classifications assigned by MARPOR/CMP in IMD3002_LR_MARPOR (and
         | originally available in IMD3100_MARPOR) are transformed into a
         | dichotomous variable. Consequently, users are advised that this
         | results in some parties/coalitions falling into different
         | categorizations on IMD3002_LR_CSES and IMD3002_LR_MARPOR.
         |
         | CSES and MARPOR/CMP have different scopes of parties/coalitions 
         | in elections and thus corresponding values assigned to
         | parties/coalitions by CSES collaborators may be unavailable in 
         | MARPOR/CMP and vice versa.
         |         
         | This variable is original to CSES IMD, and therefore there are 
         | no corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules.        
         |         
         | Data are unavailable primarily because collaborator expert 
         | judgments of parties were not provided for certain election
         | studies. Missing data for BELARUS (2001, 2008) and RUSSIA 
         | (2000, 2004) is due to most respondents report voting for  
         | independent candidates in the said elections, for which no
         | expert judgments are available. 
         |
         | Data are unavailable for BELGIUM – WALOONIA (1999), BELARUS
         | (2001, 2008), KYRGYZSTAN (2005), LITHUANIA (1997), NORWAY

         | POLITY NOTES – BELARUS: IMD3002_LR_CSES
         |
         | Presidential candidates in Belarus 2001 and 2008 elections are
         | competing under the independent banner. Thus, no straight
         | connections can be made between parties and presidential
         | candidates. Since collaborators provided left-right scores for
         | parties, but presidential elections are the main election, the
         | two Belarus studies (2001 and 2008) have been set to missing.

         | POLITY NOTES – RUSSIA: IMD3002_LR_CSES
         |
         | Presidential candidates in Russia 2001 and 2004 elections are

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES – AUSTRALIA (2007): IMD3002_LR_CSES
         |
         | Expert data on left-right is available for only four parties.
         | Two of these four are classified as left (Labor and Greens) and
         | the remaining two are classified as right (Liberal Party and
         | National Party). Thus, no middle category (center) appears in
         | the Australia (2007) study.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES – GERMANY (2009): IMD3002_LR_CSES
         |
         | Most of the A-I parties have been scored by German collaborators
         | from 4 to 6 on the left-right scale. This leads to a somewhat
         | different distribution for IMD3002_LR_CSES for Germany (2009)
         | compared to other German studies in the CSES IMD.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES – KYRGYZSTAN (2005): IMD3002_LR_CSES
         |
         | Presidential candidates in Kyrgyzstan are competing under the
         | independent banner. Thus, no straight connections can be made
         | between parties and presidential candidates. Since collaborators
         | provided left-right scores for parties, but presidential
         | elections are the main election, Kyrgyzstan (2005) study has
         | been set to missing.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES – NEW ZEALAND (2008): IMD3002_LR_CSES
         |
         | Most of the A-I parties have been scored by New Zealand
         | collaborators from 4 to 6 on the left-right scale. This leads to
         | somewhat different distribution for IMD3002_LR_CSES for New

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         This item classifies whether or not the respondent reports voting
         for a leftist or rightist party or candidate of the party. The
         classification is based on MARPOR's "RILE" index value assigned

         | DERIVATIVE VARIABLE
         |
         | This variable is available for voters who reported voting for a 
         | party receiving an alphabetical classification by CSES, and for
         | which MARPOR "rile" index data is available. For more 
         | details on which parties/coalitions receive alphabetical 
         | classification see "CSES IMD ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION 
         | CODING - RELATIONAL DATA" in CSES IMD Codebook Part 2. 
         |
         | This variable differentiates voters who voted for a leftist /
         | rightist party/candidate of a party, based on the Manifesto
         | Research on Political Representation (MARPOR/CMP) data.
         | The variable is based on the "RILE" index. The index was
         | developed by Laver and Budge (1992). It takes 24 categories (12
         | are defined as right-wing and 12 as left-wing) and subtracts the
         | sum of all right-wing items from the sum of all left-wing items.
         | The RILE index ranges from -100 (if a party only mentions left-
         | wing issues in its program) and +100 (if a party only mentions
         | right-wing issues in its program). However, these are the 
         | theoretical maximum and minimum values which are empirically
         | rare.
         |
         | More information about MARPOR/CMP data and RILE index can 
         | be found at https://manifestoproject.wzb.eu/
         | (Date accessed: October 09, 2020).
         | 
         | For IMD3100_LR_MARPOR, CSES linked the MARPOR/CMP data with the 
         | reported vote choice of the respondent in the main election.
         | A respondent who reports voting for a party/candidate of PARTY A 
         | is assigned the value the MARPOR/CMP RILE index gives to PARTY A
         | in the said election (and so on for PARTY B, PARTY C etc...). 
         | CSES reports these values in variable IMD3100_LR_MARPOR.        
         |
         | These scores provided in IMD3100_LR_MARPOR have then been 
         | re-classified for IMD3002_LR_MARPOR to establish whether a 
         | respondent voted for a leftist/rightist party/candidate. Scores 
         | assigned by collaborators are recoded into a dichotomy as 
         | follows: 
         |
         |     IMD3002_LR_MARPOR         MARPOR RILE index

         |                    01.        0.01 – 100.0
         |
         | When a party scores 0.00 on the RILE index, that usually means
         | that there is not enough data on the dimensions available to 
         | construct a reliable RILE estimate. These cases have been set to
         | "9. MISSING:"       
         | 
         | In polities where multiple elections took place simultaneously, 
         | this variable reports the vote choice in the main election. The 
         | classifications of the main elections by election study are  
         | listed in the variable notes for variable IMD3002_OUTGOV.
         |
         | CSES and MARPOR/CMP have different scopes of parties/coalitions 
         | in elections and thus corresponding values assigned to
         | parties/coalitions by CSES collaborators may be unavailable in
         | MARPOR/CMP and vice versa. 
         | In this variable, the the L-R classifications assigned by
         | MARPOR/CMP (originally available in IMD3100_MARPOR) are 
         | transformed into a dichotomous variable.
         | Meanwhile, the L-R classifications assigned by CSES Collaborators
         | (available in IMD3002_LR_CSES and originally in IMD3100_LR_CSES
         | and IMD5012 respectively) are transformed into a three-category
         | variable. Consequently, users are advised that this results in
         | some parties/coalitions falling into different categorizations
         | on IMD3002_LR_CSES and IMD3002_LR_MARPOR.
         |
         | Users are advised that CSES and MARPOR/CMP sometimes classify          
         | coalitions differently in elections and across polities. For         
         | example CSES sometimes has data solely on coalitions and not 
         | the parties comprising the alliance, while MARPOR/CMP may have 
         | data concerning the individual parties in the coalition, or 
         | vice versa. Consequently, some parties may have multiple 
         | identifiers within the MARPOR/CMP dataset across time. A non          
         | comprehensive list of these deviations are noted in Part 5  
         | of the CSES IMD Codebook in POLITY NOTES.
         |
         | This variable is original to CSES IMD, and therefore there are

         |         
         | Data are unavailable primarily because some polities, which are

         |
         | Respondents' party mentions in IMD3005_3 depend on the two 
         | former questions (IMD3005_1 and IMD3005_2). The party mention in 
         | IMD3005_3 should have only been asked for those respondents that
         | reported to be close (IMD3005_1) or at least closer (IMD3005_2) 
         | to a party.
         | However, there are several respondents that mentioned a party
         | (IMD3005_3), without feeling close (IMD3005_1) or closer 
         | (IMD3005_2) to a party. These data remained unchanged. For
         | further details on these inconsistencies, see Standalone CSES
         | Module Codebooks. 
         |
         | In MODULES 1 and 2, respondents were asked "Which party is that?"
         | For respondents who named more than one party that they identify
         | with in MODULE 1 or MODULE 2 (SQ3a, Q18A), there was
         | a follow-up question, asking respondents to specify a single
         | party they felt closest to (SQ3b, Q18B).
         | Furthermore, MODULES 1 and 2 differentiated between respondents
         | from settings where party blocs (or electoral alliances) formed
         | for the respective election and settings in which this was not
         | the case. Respondents initially indicating they identify with a
         | party bloc or an electoral alliance (SQ3a, Q18A) received a
         | follow-up question, prompting respondents to specify
         | which affiliated party they identify with most (LQ3a(1), Q18A1).
         | For the CSES IMD, in case a respondent provided only one answer 
         | to A3005_/B3029_, this answer was adopted for IMD3005_3,
         | irrespective of whether respondents named a single party or an
         | electoral alliance. In cases respondents initially provided
         | multiple parties that they feel close to, as indicated by 
         | A3006/B3030, Q3b/Q18B was used for IMD3005_3. 
         | Finally, Q13d/Q18D was used if respondents replied NO to 
         | IMD3005_1 (Are you close to any political party) but replied 
         | YES to IMD3005_2 (Do you feel closer to one party).

         | answered of respondents if they reported to feel closer to one
         | party than the others in A3010 ("1. YES"). However, in multiple
         | election studies, respondents who are coded as "9. MISSING" for
         | variable A3010 are also coded as "9" for variable A3010,

         |
         | IMD3006 asked respondents to place themselves on a 0-10 
         | left-right ideological scale.
         |
         | Placement of this question in successive Standalone CSES Module 
         | questionnaires varies and thus might have resulted in a small
         | deviation in the introduction to the question - please consult 
         | the Standalone CSES Module Codebooks for more information.
         |         
         | In the following, question wordings for each Module are listed.
         |
         | MODULES 1 and 2:
         | "In politics people sometimes talk of left and right. 
         | Where would you place yourself on a scale from 0 to 10
         | where 0 means the left and 10 means the right?"
         |
         | MODULES 3 and 4:
         | "Where would you place yourself on this scale?"
         |         
         | In MODULE 1, respondents were first asked to place themselves 
         | on the left-right scale before placing parties on the same scale.
         | That question order was reversed for MODULES 2 to 4. 
         |
         | The CSES asks collaborators to ask the left-right
         | scale questions even if left-right is not considered to be
         | meaningful/important/widely understood in the area being
         | studied. However, it was possible to add an optional
         | alternative scale question on which respondents were asked to 
         | place parties A - I and themselves. These alternative scale 
         | questions were not harmonized for the IMD, but are available
         | in the separate MODULES 1 to 4.
         |
         | Several respondents mentioned not to know the left-right scale
         | in one of the appropriate variables on IMD3006 or IMD3007_, but
         | evaluated the other parties on even that scale. These data

         | the Standalone CSES Module Codebooks for more information.
         | In the following, question wordings for each Module are listed. 
         |
         | MODULE 1:
         | "And now, using the same scale, I'd like to
         | ask you how much you like or dislike some political leaders.
         | Again, if I come to a leader you haven't heard of or you do not
         | know enough about them, just say so. The first political leader 
         | is LEADER A."
         |
         | MODULES 3 and 4:
         | "And what do you think of the presidential candidates/
         | party leaders? After I read the name of a presidential
         | candidate/party leader, please rate them on a scale from
         | 0 to 10, where 0 means you strongly dislike that
         | candidate and 10 means that you strongly like that
         | candidate. If I come to a presidential candidate/party
         | leader you haven't heard of or you feel you do not know
         | enough about, just say so.
         | The first is [LEADER A].
         | Using the same scale, where would you place, [LEADER B]?
         | Using the same scale, where would you place, [LEADER C]?
         | Using the same scale, where would you place, [LEADER D]?
         | Using the same scale, where would you place, [LEADER E]?
         | Using the same scale, where would you place, [LEADER F]?
         | Using the same scale, where would you place, [LEADER G]?
         | Using the same scale, where would you place, [LEADER H]?
         | Using the same scale, where would you place, [LEADER I]?"  
         |      
         | Leaders and their alphabetical classifications for each country
         | are detailed in Part 3 of the CSES IMD Codebook. For linking
         | alphabetical to numerical party codes, please see VARIABLE NOTES
         | on D5000_.  
         | For more detailed information on how CSES codes parties/
         | coalitions and leaders, please see Part 3 of the CSES IMD
         | Codebook. 
         |
         | Users should note that IMD3009_ includes several observations in 
         | which all leaders are scored equally by respondents. Also, there
         | may be instances in which respondents provide the same answer to
         | all items, e.g. "don't know". These data remain unchanged. 
         | For further details on these inconsistencies, see variable and
         | election study notes in the Standalone CSES Module Codebooks. 
         |
         | IMD3009_ was not included as a regular question in the MODULE 2
         | questionnaire. Therefore, data on IMD3009_ is not available for
         | most of the studies from MODULE 2. Two exemptions are AUSTRALIA
         | (2004) and BRAZIL (2002). These countries included IMD3009_ as
         | an optional scale question (see B3041_, Codebook Part 2 of

         | Respondents outside of a region where a party contested the
         | election were not asked to evaluate its leaders. These
         | respondents are coded as 97 in CSES MODULE 1 but were re-coded  
         | to "99. MISSING" for IMD. This applies to the Scottish National

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - JAPAN (2004): IMD3010
         |
         | In CSES MODULE 2 for Satisfaction with democracy variable,

IMD3011       >>> EFFICACY: WHO IS IN POWER CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Some people say that it doesn't make any difference who is in
         power. Others say that it makes a big difference who is in power.
         Using the scale on this card, (where ONE means that it
         doesn't make any difference who is in power and FIVE means
         that it makes a big difference who is in power), where would
         you place yourself?
         ..................................................................

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD3011
         |
         | For MODULES 1 and 2, IMD3011 had an inversed scale running from
         | "1. IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE WHO IS IN POWER" to "5. IT DOESN'T 
         | MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHO IS IN POWER". These scales were re-coded 
         | to fit the coding of IMD3011 as outlined above.
         | For MODULES 1 and 2, therefore, question-wording reflects the 
         | inversed scale and deviated slightly from the recent version 
         | applied for the CSES IMD.     
         |
         | In MODULE 2, some election studies used an earlier version of 
         | the CSES questionnaire which included the words "BIG" and "ANY" 
         | in the question text and response options.
         |
         | For example:
         | "1. It makes a BIG difference who is in power"
         | "5. It doesn't make ANY difference who is in power"
         |
         | As a result, there has been variation in question-wording and
         | response options for IMD3011 in MODULE 2. A table documenting
         | how election studies asked these items is available in CSES  
         | MODULE 2 Codebook (Part 2 below variable B3013).

IMD3012       >>> EFFICACY: WHO PEOPLE VOTE FOR MAKES A DIFFERENCE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Some people say that no matter who people vote for, it won't
         make any difference to what happens. Others say that who
         people vote for can make a big difference to what happens.
         Using the scale on this card, (where ONE means that voting
         won't make any difference to what happens and FIVE means that
         voting can make a big difference), where would you place
         yourself?

         | In CSES MODULES 1-3, most studies included up to three political 
         | information items, designed to test respondents' general 
         | knowledge. These items were designed by CSES collaborators and  
         | therefore vary across studies both in content and in difficulty. 
         | 
         | For CSES MODULES 2 and 3, the CSES questionnaire provided advice
         | to collaborators on how to assess political information, namely:
         | "These items are designed to indicate the respondents' general 
         | political knowledge. They should be coded as shown below. The
         | set of questions should include one that is easy (i.e. 2/3 will
         | answer correctly), one that is slightly more difficult (i.e. 1/2 
         | will answer correctly), and one that is difficult (i.e. 1/3 
         | will answer correctly)."
         | 
         | The question wordings of the items used in CSES MODULES 1-3, and 
         | their correct answers, are reported in the ELECTION STUDY NOTES 
         | below.

         |
         | CANADA (2011) and IRELAND (2011) fielded the CSES MODULE 4 pilot
         | questionnaire. In the pilot version, items for IMD3015_2 and

         |
         | The Belgium Wallonia study (1999) fielded eight items assessing
         | a respondent's level of political knowledge, which are available
         | in the original French questionnaire on the CSES Homepage
         | (question 74, page 30). The CSES MODULE 1 Codebook does not 
         | include any information on which three out of those eight items
         | were selected for inclusion into CSES MODULE 1. The best guess of
         | the CSES Secretariat is that those three knowledge items were 
         | selected for CSES MODULE 1 that resemble the questions from the
         | Belgium Flanders (1999) study, namely:

         |
         | Scales in IMD3015_A - IMD3015_D indicate the number of correct 
         | answers each respondent provided to the political information 
         | items included in the Standalone CSES Modules. As political 
         | information items differed both between polities and election 
         | studies from the same polities, one separate variable for each
         | CSES Module was created.
         |
         | As the number of political information items respondents were 
         | exposed to differed between Standalone CSES Modules, two separate
         | scales were created: 
         |
         | CSES MODULES 1, 2, and 3 featured three political information 
         | items, such that the number of correct answers per respondent
         | ranges between 0 and 3. Scores on the 0-3 scale are provided 
         | in IMD3015_A (MODULE 1), IMD3015_B (MODULE 2), and IMD3015_C 
         | (MODULE 3).
         |
         | CSES MODULE 4 featured four political information items, such 
         | that the number of correct answers per respondent ranges between
         | 0 and 4. Scores on the 0-4 scale are provided in IMD3015_D.
         | 
         | Some studies included fewer political information items than 
         | envisaged by the Standalone CSES Module questionnaire. IMD3015_A-
         | IMD3015_D were not calculated for respondents from these studies.

         | receiving an alphabetical classification by CSES). For more 
         | details on which parties/coalitions receive alphabetical 
         | classification see "CSES IMD ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION 
         | CODING - RELATIONAL DATA" in CSES IMD Codebook Part 2.

         | This variable assigns respondents a score based on respondent 
         | reported vote choice and the corresponding expert judgment 
         | of the CSES Collaborators on the left-right ideology scale for 
         | the party the respondent reports voting for.        
         | Collaborators assign parties scores on an 11-point scale ranging
         | from "0. LEFT" to "10. RIGHT" for all parties assigned an 
         | alphabetical code by CSES. The expert judgment data by party 
         | is available in variable IMD5012_.
         |
         | Some parties/coalitions have scores that are not round numbers,
         | e.g., 1.5 or 3.5. These scores can reflect collaborator
         | judgments or reflect the classification of a coalition. 
         | Sometimes respondents report voting for a coalition, but
         | collaborators score parties that comprise this coalition
         | separately on the L-R scale. The score used for IMD3100_LR_CSES
         | is the mean of L-R scores of parties that comprise the given
         | coalition. 
         | All of these instances are detailed in ELECTION STUDY NOTES 
         | below.        
         |
         | This variable links the CSES Collaborator expert judgment with  
         | the reported vote of the respondent in the main election. Here, 
         | a respondent who reports voting for a party/candidate of PARTY A
         | is assigned the value the CSES Collaborator gave to PARTY A in 
         | the said election on the left-right scale (and so on for PARTY B, 
         | PARTY C etc...). The classifications of the main elections by
         | election study are listed in the variable notes for variable

         | - 2760003.  Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU)
         |
         | In all German studies in CSES IMD, these parties received

         | each party separately on the L-R scale.
         |
         | In 1998, German collaborators assigned the following L-R scores
         | - Christian Democratic Party (L-R score = 6)
         | - Christian Social Union in Bavaria (L-R score = 7)
         | Thus, the score for the Union in 1998 for the IMD3100_LR_CSES is
         | 6.5.
         |
         | In 2002, German collaborators assigned the following L-R scores
         | - Christian Democratic Party (L-R score = 7)
         | - Christian Social Union in Bavaria (L-R score = 8)
         | Thus, the score for the Union in 1998 for the IMD3100_LR_CSES is
         | 7.5. These scores are assigned to these parties in both German
         | 2002 studies, telephone and mail-back.

         | - Christian Democratic Party (L-R score = 7)
         | - Christian Social Union in Bavaria (L-R score = 8)
         | Thus, the score for the Union in 1998 for the IMD3100_LR_CSES is
         | 7.5.
         |
         | In 2009, German collaborators assigned the following L-R scores
         | - Christian Democratic Party (L-R score = 5)
         | - Christian Social Union in Bavaria (L-R score = 5)
         | Thus, the score for the Union in 1998 for the IMD3100_LR_CSES is
         | 5.
         |
         | In 2013, German collaborators assigned the following L-R scores
         | - Christian Democratic Party (L-R score = 6)
         | - Christian Social Union in Bavaria (L-R score = 7)

         | DERIVATIVE VARIABLE
         |
         | This variable is available for voters who reported voting for a 
         | party receiving an alphabetical classification by CSES. For
         | more details on which parties/coalitions receive alphabetical 
         | classification see "CSES IMD ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION 
         | CODING - RELATIONAL DATA" in CSES IMD Codebook Part 2. 
         |
         | This variable assigns respondents a score based on respondent 
         | reported vote choice and the corresponding value of that party 
         | on the MARPOR "rile" index. This index was developed by Laver
         | and Budge (1992). It takes 24 categories (12 are defined as
         | right-wing and 12 as left-wing) and subtracts the sum of all
         | right-wing items from the sum of all left-wing items.
         | The rile index ranges from -100 (if a party only mentions left
         | wing issues in its program) and +100 (if a party only talks
         | about right-wing issues). However, these are only theoretical
         | maximum and minimum, which are empirically very rare,
         | as most parties talk about both – left and right issues.
         |
         | This variable links the MARPOR "rile" index value with the  
         | reported vote of the respondent in the main election. Here, a
         | respondent who reports voting for a party/candidate of PARTY A
         | is assigned the value MARPOR "rile" index gave to PARTY A in
         | the said election (and so on for PARTY B, PARTY C etc...). The 
         | classification of the main election by election study are listed 
         | in the variable notes for variable IMD3002_OUTGOV.

         |
         | Users are advised that CSES and MARPOR/CMP sometimes classify          
         | coalitions differently in elections and across polities. For         
         | example CSES sometimes has data solely on coalitions and not 
         | the parties comprising the alliance, while MARPOR/CMP may have 
         | data concerning the individual parties in the coalition, or 
         | vice versa. Consequently, some parties may have multiple 
         | identifiers within the MARPOR/CMP dataset across time. A non          
         | comprehensive list of these deviations are noted in Part 5  
         | of the CSES IMD Codebook in POLITY NOTES.
         |
         | This variable is original to CSES IMD, and therefore there are no
         | corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules.
         |         
         | Data are unavailable primarily because some polities, which are

         | For the CSES IMD, this alphabetical structure was maintained, 
         | meaning that alphabetical codes assigned to parties/coalitions
         | and leaders in Standalone CSES Modules were not changed. Rather, 
         | IMD5000_ serves as an identifier in the dataset, providing 
         | the unique and unambiguous numerical party codes listed in 
         | Part 3 of the CSES IMD Codebook. As codes in IMD5000_ are  
         | labeled with the corresponding party names, they allow 
         | easy identification of the relational data within the dataset. 
         |
         | For the CSES IMD dataset, alphabetical codes are used to 
         | identify the following:
         | - Respondent's likability of the party/coalition 
         |   (variable IMD3008_). 
         | - Respondent's left-right placement of the party/coalition 
         |   (variable IMD3007_).
         | - Election Results: percentage of vote for each party/coalition 
         |   in lower house (variable IMD5001_)
         | - Election Results: percentage of seats for each party/coalition 
         |   in lower house (variable IMD5002_)
         | - Election Results: percentage of vote for each party/coalition 
         |   in upper house (variable IMD5003_)
         | - Election Results: percentage of seats for each party/coalition 
         |   in upper house (variable IMD5004_)
         | - Election Results: percentage of vote for each party/coalition 
         |   in presidential election (variable IMD5005_)
         | - Expert judgments by the national collaborators of the said 
         |   party/coalition's ideological family placement 
         |   (variable IMD5011_).
         | - Expert judgments by the national collaborators of the 
         |   said party/coalition's left-right placement (variable 
         |   IMD5012).
         | - Number of cabinet portfolios held by each party/coalition 
         |   before the election (variable IMD5029_).
         | - Number of cabinet portfolios held by each party/coalition after
         |   the election (variable IMD5031_).     
         | 
         | In most cases, the alphabetical party codes correspond to the
         | alphabetical code for the leader of that same party (e.g., 
         | LEADER A is the leader of PARTY A). However, there are 
         | exceptions, such as in instances in which data is available for
         | two leaders of the same party (e.g., Ireland 2011 in CSES MODULE
         | 4). For more detailed information on how CSES codes parties/
         | coalitions and leaders, please see Part 4 of the CSES IMD
         | Codebook.
         |
         | This variable is original to CSES IMD, and therefore there are 
         | no corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules.

         | 
         | The Voting Age Population (VAP) includes all citizens above the
         | legal voting age in a country. It is not intended to be a 
         | precise measure of the number of citizens entitled to vote as it
         | does not take into account legal or systematic impediments such 
         | as resident non-citizens. Rather, its intent is to provide an 
         | estimate of turnout besides estimates based solely on an 
         | electoral register. Voter registers are often outdated or 
         | inaccurate or in some circumstances are not used for elections
         | (e.g.: 1994 South African elections).         
         |
         | In some polities, voters are registered automatically and hence
         | it might be expected that the electoral register measure and the
         | voting age population would be identical. This is not always the
         | case for the reasons set out above. However, and unless we can
         | verify accuracy, CSES reports the voting age population as 
         | listed by the IDEA. However, ELECTION STUDY NOTES, available in
         | Part 2 of the Codebooks for the respective Standalone CSES 
         | Modules, do alert users to instances where voter registration
         | is automatic and thus to cases for which in theory the ER 
         | and VAP estimates could be identical.

         | POLITY NOTES - RUSSIA: IMD5008_1
         | 
         | Vladimir Putin was Russia's Prime Minister (formally: "Chairman 
         | of the Government of the Russian Federation"), before the Russian
         | 1999 parliamentary election and the 2000 Presidential election.    
         | Although Putin was formally independent, he supported Unity 
         | (IMD numeric party code 6430051) at the 1999 election and was
         | backed by Unity after that election. 
         | Therefore, in his role as Prime Minister, Putin is coded as 
         | being affiliated to Unity.
         | However, additionally to his role as incumbent Prime Minister, 
         | Putin became acting President of Russia, after Boris Yeltsin's
         | resignation on December 31, 1999 - resulting in early 
         | Presidential elections on March 26, 2000 (see POLITY NOTES on 
         | IMD5009_ for more information). 
         | After Putin was confirmed as President, Mikhail Kasyanov became
         | Prime Minister, who was independent at that time. 

         | [POLITY NOTES] - SWITZERLAND: IMD5008_1
         |
         | There is no formal Prime Minister in Switzerland. Instead, 
         | executive power is exercised by a collective organism called the
         | Federal Council of Switzerland. This organism has seven members
         | and is elected by the Federal Assembly (which is composed of two
         | organs, the Council of States and National Council) for a 
         | four-year term. Since 1959 the Federal Council has been composed
         | of a coalition of all major parties (SVP/UDC, SP/PS, FDP/PRD, 
         | and CVP/PDC), an arrangement called the "magic formula". The 
         | Council elects each year among its members a president, but this
         | position is presumably largely ceremonial. Consequently, this 
         | variable is coded with 9999997 "Not applicable".

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - FRANCE 2002: IMD5008_1

         | elections, held on April 21 (first round) and May 5, 2002 (second
         | round). Incumbent Prime Minister Lionel Jospin contested as 
         | Presidential candidate for the Socialist Party (PS). After Jospin
         | missed the second round, he resigned from politics.
         | Jean-Pierre Raffarin became Prime Minister after the 2002 
         | Presidential election. By that time, Raffarin was still a member 
         | of Liberal Democracy, a party that officially merged into the 
         | Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) in November 2002. Therefore, 
         | Raffarin is coded as belonging to the UMP for IMD5008_2.

         | French 2007 legislative election is coded as being a member of   
         | the Greens (V). 
         | However, both Dominique de Villepin, who resigned as Prime 
         | Minister on May 15, 2007, and Francois Fillon, his successor, 
         | were members of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). Hence,

         | parliamentary election is coded as being a member of Civic 
         | Platform (PO). 
         | However, the outgoing Prime Minister was Jaroslaw Kaczynski, 
         | a member of Law and Justice (PiS). Hence, IMD5008_1 was recoded
         | to "6160002. Law and Justice (PiS)" for Poland 2007.
         | Donald Tusk, who became Prime Minister after the 2007 election,
         | was a member of Civic Plattform (PO). Hence, IMD5008_2 was 
         | recoded to "6160001. Civic Platform (PO)" for Poland 2007, as
         | the coding of IMD5008_2 in MODULE 3 refers to the Polish

         | parliamentary election is coded as being a member of Liberal 
         | Democracy of Slovenia (LDS).
         | However, the outgoing Prime Minister was Janez Jansa, a member of
         | Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS). Hence, IMD5008_1 was recoded
         | to "7050001. Social Democratic Party (SDS)" for Slovenia 2008.
         | Borut Pahor, who became Prime Minister after the 2008 election,
         | was a member of the Social Democrats (SD). Hence, IMD5008_2 was 
         | recoded to "7050002. Social Democrats (SD)", as the coding of

         | There is no formal Prime Minister in Switzerland. Instead, 
         | executive power is exercised by a collective organism called the
         | Federal Council of Switzerland. This organism has seven members
         | and is elected by the Federal Assembly (which is composed of two
         | organs, the Council of States and National Council) for a 
         | four-year term. Since 1959 the Federal Council has been composed
         | of a coalition of all major parties (SVP/UDC, SP/PS, FDP/PRD, 
         | and CVP/PDC), an arrangement called the "magic formula". The 
         | Council elects each year among its members a president, but this
         | position is presumably largely ceremonial. Consequently, this 
         | variable is coded with 9999997 "Not applicable".

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - FRANCE 2002: IMD5008_2
         |
         | The French 2002 election study refers to the Presidential 
         | elections, held on April 21 (first round) and May 5, 2002 (second
         | round). Incumbent Prime Minister Lionel Jospin contested as 
         | Presidential candidate for the Socialist Party (PS). After Jospin
         | missed the second round, he resigned from politics.
         | Jean-Pierre Raffarin became Prime Minister after the 2002 
         | Presidential election. By that time, Raffarin was still a member 
         | of Liberal Democracy, a party that officially merged into the 
         | Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) in November 2002. Therefore, 
         | Raffarin is coded as belonging to the UMP for IMD5008_2.

         |
         | In CSES MODULE 3, the Prime Minister before and after the 
         | French 2007 legislative election is coded as being a member of   
         | the Greens (V). 
         | However, both Dominique de Villepin, who resigned as Prime 
         | Minister on May 15, 2007, and Francois Fillon, his successor, 
         | were members of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). Hence, 
         | both IMD5008_ variables have been recoded to "2500001. Union for
         | a Popular Movement (UMP)" for France 2007.

         | parliamentary election is coded as being a member of Civic 
         | Plattform (PO). 
         | However, the outgoing Prime Minister was Jaroslaw Kaczynski, 
         | a member of Law and Justice (PiS). Hence, IMD5008_1 was recoded
         | to "6160002. Law and Justice (PiS)" for Poland 2007.
         | Donald Tusk, who became Prime Minister after the 2007 election,
         | was a member of Civic Plattform (PO). Hence, IMD5008_2 was 
         | recoded to "6160001. Civic Platform (PO)" for Poland 2007, as
         | the coding of IMD5008_2 in MODULE 3 refers to the Polish
         | Peasant Party.

         | parliamentary election is coded as being a member of Liberal 
         | Democracy of Slovenia (LDS).
         | However, the outgoing Prime Minister was Janez Jansa, a member of
         | Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS). Hence, IMD5008_1 was recoded
         | to "7050001. Social Democratic Party (SDS)" for Slovenia 2008.
         | Borut Pahor, who became Prime Minister after the 2008 election,
         | was a member of the Social Democrats (SD). Hence, IMD5008_2 was 
         | recoded to "7050002. Social Democrats (SD)", as the coding of 
         | IMD5008_2 in MODULE 3 also refers to the LDS.

         | 
         | Before and after the 1999 Russian parliamentary election, Boris
         | Yeltsin (independent) was President of Russia. 
         | However, Yeltsin resigned from office on December 31, 1999, 
         | resulting in early Presidential elections on March 26, 2000.
         | Incumbent Prime Minister Vladimir Putin became acting President
         | and won the 2000 and 2004 Presidential elections as an 
         | independent candidate (IMD Code 6430101). 
         | In his role as Prime Minister, Putin supported and was backed
         | by Unity, and is therefore coded as being affiliated to Unity
         | in IMD5008_ (Party of the Prime Minister Before / After).

         | However, in preparation for the legislative election, which took

         | created the "Union for the Presidential Majority", to contest 
         | the legislative election jointly with several other center-right
         | parties. This alliance formally turned into the Union for a 
         | Popular Movement (UMP) later the same year. Therefore, for

         |
         | MAJORITARIAN systems require successful candidates to win either
         | a plurality or majority of the vote. As a result, they are
         | considered majoritarian.
         |
         | PROPORTIONAL systems can be divided into two types: those that 
         | use party lists and those like the single transferable vote that 
         | do not. Those systems employing lists can themselves be divided 
         | into two further categories: quota systems (with allocation of
         | remainders) and highest average systems.
         |
         | MIXED systems use a mixture of majoritarian and proportional
         | electoral rules. A country can be classified as having a mixed
         | system whether it uses one or more electoral segments (tiers); in
         | practice, most mixed systems have more than one segment (tier).
         | Mixed electoral systems can be divided into those in which the
         | two electoral formulas are dependent and those in which they are
         | independent.

         | IMD5014 is a system variable, meaning that it measured at the 
         | at the polity level. Consequently, the variable is coded for a 
         | polity even though a presidential may not have taken place 
         | (e.g., Mexico 2003).
         |         
         | PLURALITY - the candidate that obtains the most votes wins.
         |
         | ABSOLUTE MAJORITY RULE - A candidate must win over 50% of the
         | vote to win. If no  candidate wins this many votes, then there is
         | a runoff between the top two candidates.
         |
         | QUALIFIED MAJORITY RULE - Each qualified majority system 
         | specifies a particular percentage of the vote that a candidate 
         | must win in order to be elected in the first round. If two or 
         | more candidates overcome these thresholds, then the one with the 
         | highest number of votes wins. The qualified majority systems vary 
         | in terms of the electoral procedure that applies when these 
         | thresholds are not met.
         |
         | ELECTORAL COLLEGE - The candidate that wins a plurality of the
         | electoral college votes wins.
         |
         | SINGLE TRANSFERABLE VOTE - Requires voters to rank single
         | candidates in order of the most to least preferred. Votes are
         | transferred until candidates obtain the Droop quota. The
         | candidate that obtains this quota first is elected.

         | POLITY NOTES - AUSTRALIA: IMD5016_
         |
         | For lower house elections, Australia employs the Alternative
         | Vote system. In this system, voters are required
         | to list their  preferences for as many candidates
         | as there are on the ballot. Thus, the total number of votes
         | varies across electoral districts.
         |
         | For upper house elections, Australia employs a single-
         | transferable-vote form of proportional representation. In this
         | system each voter indicates the order of preference among all
         | the candidates in competing in her district, or alternatively,
         | she can indicate support for a party ticket (which determines
         | the order of preference of candidates within the party).

         | [POLITY NOTES] - BELGIUM: IMD5016_3 - IMD5016_4
         |
         | Previously, the process of electing Senators in Belgium was a
         | mixture, some were indirectly elected, and 40 Senators were
         | directly elected (25 in Flanders, 15 in Wallonia). For these
         | elections voters used to cast one vote (one-tier system). That
         | is why all three Belgium studies have been coded "97. Not
         | applicable" for the variable IMD5016_4 in CSES IMD.
         | The law changed in 2014 and Senators in Belgium are not directly
         | elected anymore.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - BRAZIL: IMD5016_3
         |
         | Members of the Brazilian Senate (Senado Federal) are elected
         | for an 8-year term and the chamber is composed of 81 members, 
         | with each state in Brazil having three Senators each. 
         | Members are elected in alternative electoral cycles: two thirds 
         | of the Senate seats (n=54) are contested in one election cycle 
         | while the remaining one third are contested in the other.
         | In 2002 and 2010, two-thirds of the Senate were renewed, giving
         | voters two votes in these upper house elections.	 
         | The 2006 and 2014 elections saw a third of the Senate seats
         | contested (n=27). Accordingly, voters therefore had one vote in
         | these elections as only one Senator per State was being
         | selected.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - CZECH REPUBLIC: IMD5016_3
         |
         | Czech Republic (1996, 2002) studies have been coded "97. Not
         | applicable" because these studies do not refer to Upper House
         | elections.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - HONG KONG: IMD5016_
         |
         | Hong Kong adopted a constitutional reform package in 2010, which
         | also affected the election law. Reforms increased the size of
         | the unicameral Legislative Council of the HKSAR to 70 members.
         | Half of the legislative council is returned by geographic
         | constituency (popular) elections; the other half is returned by
         | functional constituency elections.
         | Election data on Hong Kong electoral institutions refer to the 
         | geographical constituency elections only.
         | In the Geographical Constituency (GC) part of the Election, Hong
         | Kong is divided into 5 constituencies and voters elect 
         | candidates by universal suffrage. The number of LegCo seats in 
         | each constituency is decided according to the constituency 
         | population. The voting system adopted is the closed list 
         | proportional representation system. Geographical Constituency is
         | treated here as the first segment of the LegCo.
         | There are two parts of the Functional Constituencies (FCs): the 
         | traditional FCs and the District Council (Second) FC.
         | The traditional FCs return 30 LegCo members. Registration as a 
         | voter in some traditional Fcs requires certain qualifications, 
         | for example, registered medical practitioners or dentists for 
         | the Medical FC. Note that in some FCs, voters are individuals, 
         | while in others, 'voters' are not individuals but companies or 
         | organizations.
         | The District Council (Second) FC was created in 2012 and is 
         | treated here as the second segment of the LegCo. This segment 
         | returns 5 LegCo members. In this part of election, the whole of 
         | Hong Kong has one constituency only and the voting system adopted
         | is the closed-list proportional representation system. Candidates
         | must be elected District Council members who are nominated by no 
         | less than 15 other elected District Council members; whereas 
         | voters are registered GC electors who are not registered in
         | other FCs.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - MEXICO: IMD5016_1 - IMD5016_2
         |
         | Mexican voters cast a single vote in a single-member district
         | plurality election. However, this also counts for the allocation
         | of the proportional representation seats disputed in the larger
         | regional multi-member districts (five circumscriptions). Thus,
         | voters are not allowed to split their vote, in fact, the same
         | vote is subject to a double-counting that produces two-seat
         | relevant vote totals. The first vote total determines who wins
         | the plurality in the single-member district (300 seats). The
         | second serves to allocate seats in the multi-member districts
         | (200 seats). The PR seats are allocated according to the
         | aggregate distribution of votes of multi-member districts.
         | For a party to be entitled to have members of proportional
         | representation in the Lower Chamber, it must attain at
         | least 2% of the total votes cast for these elections.
         |
         | Since voters in Mexico cast a single vote, all Mexican studies
         | have been coded "97. Not applicable" for variable IMD5016_2.
         | This is a change in IMD compared with CSES Standalone Module.
         | The change applies to Mexico 1997 and 2000 studies.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - NETHERLANDS: IMD5016_3 - IMD5016_4
         |
         | Members of the Senate (Eerste Kamer) of the Dutch Parliament
         | (the States General) are elected indirectly - by the members
         | of the twelve Provincial Councils. Thus, coding for Netherlands
         | 1998 and 2002 studies is set to "97, Not applicable" which is
         | not the case in Standalone Modules.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - NORWAY: IMD5016_
         |
         | The Norwegian Parliament comprises 169 seats in two tiers:
         | 150 members are elected in 19 multi-member districts using
         | proportional representation. The remaining 19 seats are
         | compensatory and are allocated to parties that receive 4%+ of
         | the national vote. These seats are known as "members at large"
         | and are seen as a means of evening out discrepancies between
         | the number of votes received and the number of seats in the
         | Storting. The distribution is based on a comparison of the
         | actual distribution of seats with what would have occurred
         | had the country been treated as one big constituency, thus
         | allowing a determination to be made as to which parties are
         | under-represented. These parties are then awarded "seats at
         | large" in the constituencies where they were closest to winning
         | an ordinary seat. While voters do not cast a ballot directly for
         | this tier and the seats are awarded at the national level
         | (albeit dispersed at the constituency level), it is widely 
         | acknowledged to constitute a separate tier of the electoral 
         | system.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - PHILIPPINES: IMD5016_3
         |
         | The Philippines Senate (Senado) has 24 members, serving six-
         | years terms. Concurrently with presidential elections, half
         | of the Senate (12 members) is renewed every three years, in a
         | single nation-wide constituency. Senators are elected
         | according to the simple majority, and each voter can cast
         | up to 12 votes. Hence, vote percentages and national totals
         | are not meaningful figures.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - POLAND: IMD5016_2
         |
         | Constitution reform in 1997 and the changed divisions of 1999
         | required reform of the electoral system. System changed before 
         | the 2001 elections seeing the final liquidation of the party list
         | system where some MPs were elected based on nationwide support
         | and some based on the support from local constituencies. This
         | changed in the mentioned reform, and Polish citizens, in the
         | subsequent Parliamentary elections covered by CSES (2001-2011)
         | casted a single vote.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - POLAND: IMD5016_3
         |
         | In Senate election, voters have as many votes as there are
         | candidates to be elected in a district (between 1 and 4).
         | Thus, all Poland studies have been coded "91. OTHER [SEE
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES]" for the variable IMD5016_3. Coding has
         | changed for the following Polish studies: 1997, 2005, 2007 and

         | system, a one-tier system. Since there has not been a rule
         | change in between elections covered by CSES, Slovenia 1996 and
         | 2004 studies are coded "97. Not applicable" for the CSES IMD.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - SPAIN: IMD5016_3
         | 
         | The Senate contains 208 directly elected seats and 56 
         | indirectly elected seats. This section refers to the directly 
         | elected section. There are 52 multi-member constituencies 
         | corresponding to the country's provinces, plus Ceuta and Melilla
         | The provinces elect 4 Senators each. In the case of insular 
         | provinces, major islands elect 3 Senators each while small 
         | islands elect 1 Senator each. The autonomous cities of Ceuta 
         | and Melilla elect 2 Senators each.
         | Thus, Spain (1996, 2004 and 2004) studies have been recoded to
         | 3 for the variable IMD5016_3.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - THAILAND: IMD5016_
         |
         | Under the 2007 Constitution, a new electoral system was adopted, 
         | reintroducing a modified version of a previous form of electoral 
         | system (the one preceding the 1997 constitution). There are 400 
         | single-seat districts were combined into larger 
         | districts: 4 single-seat, 63 with 2 seats, and 90 with 3 seats. 
         | These constituencies use the Block Vote (BV) system which allows 
         | voters to cast as many ballots as there are seats in a district.
         | Voters are not permitted to cast all their votes for a single
         | candidate but can split their votes between candidates nominated
         | by different parties, for a total of 400 seats. Parallel to this
         | tier, 80 seats are distributed according to PR list, in 8 
         | regional  constituencies of roughly equivalent proportions, 
         | without a threshold. Each party submits a list with 10 
         | candidates who are listed once, and who can also contest 
         | constituency seats.

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - FRANCE (2002): IMD5016_3
         |
         | France (2002) has been coded "97. NOT APPLICABLE" for variable
         | IMD5016_3 because members of Senate (French Upper House) are
         | indirectly elected.

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - GERMANY (1998): IMD5016_3
         |
         | GERMANY (1998) has been coded "97. NOT APPLICABLE" for variable
         | IMD5016_3 because members of Bundesrat (German Upper House) are
         | indirectly elected.

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - TAIWAN (1996): IMD5016_
         |
         | In 1996, Taiwan held Presidential elections. Coding for variables
         | IMD5016_2 - IMD5016_4 for Taiwan (1996) study in CSES MODULE 1
         | refers to the system, and not the election in question. For the
         | IMD these codes have been changed into "97. Not applicable."
         |
         | After 2004, Taiwan underwent electoral reform, and 2008
         | elections were the first in Taiwan held under a mixed-member
         | system based on a two-ballot design incorporating single-member
         | districts and party-list seats.

         Do they vote for candidates (not party lists) or party
         lists?
         Definition: Party bloc voting is used in multi-member
         districts where voters cast a single party-centered vote for
         their party of choice; the party with the most votes wins
         all of the district seats.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - BELGIUM: IMD5017_4
         |
         | Senators from the second segment are indirectly elected, by two
         | electoral colleges (French and Dutch). Thus, all Belgium studies
         | have been coded "7. Not applicable" for the variable IMD5017_4.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - BRAZIL: IMD5017_1
         |
         | Each political party presents a list of candidates. Voters can
         | vote for a candidate or they can vote for a party. Thus, all
         | studies have been recoded to "4. Other" for the variable
         | IMD5017_1.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - CHILE: IMD5017_
         |
         | Each political coalition presents a list of a maximum of two
         | candidates per electoral district, normally each from a
         | different party of the coalition. Voters vote for one candidate
         | of one of the lists. However, parties present lists, and thus
         | all Chile studies have been coded "2. Party lists" for the
         | variables IMD5017_1 and IMD5017_3.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - CZECH REPUBLIC: IMD5017_3
         |
         | None of the Czech Republic studies in CSES Standalone modules
         | does not deal with the upper house election in the country.
         | Thus, all Czech studies have been recoded to "7. Not applicable"
         | for the variable IMD5017_3.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - DENMARK: IMD5017_1
         |
         | Voters can choose to endorse a party, a candidate on a party 
         | list, or an independent candidate. Parties can choose to have
         | either an open or a party ranked list of candidates. If the 
         | list is open votes that are cast on the party (the voter has 
         | not given a personal vote) are distributed between the 
         | candidates based on the number of personal votes. If the list 
         | is party ranked a vote cast on the party will be given to the
         | candidate listed first on the list until he or she has 
         | received enough votes to be elected and so on. Thus, all studies
         | for Denmark have been recoded to "4. Other" for variable
         | IMD5017_1.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - FRANCE: IMD5017_3
         |
         | The Upper House (Senate) of French Parliament constitutes of 348
         | members who are indirectly elected by elected officials. Thus,
         | all French studies have been coded "7. Not applicable" for the
         | variable IMD5017_3.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - GERMANY: IMD5017_3
         |
         | The Upper House (Bundesrat) of German Parliament constitutes of
         | 69 members who are indirectly elected. Thus, all German studies
         | have been coded "7. Not applicable" for the variable IMD5017_3.

         | POLITY NOTES - HONG KONG: IMD5017_
         |
         | Hong Kong adopted a constitutional reform package in 2010, which
         | also affected the election law. Geographical Constituency (GC)
         | and Functional constituency (FG) constitute two segments, tiers.
         | In both tiers, voters cast a vote for candidates.
         | Please consult the POLITY NOTE for IMD5016_.
         |
         | Prior to the 2010 reform, in geographical constituency elections,
         | each voter can casted 1 vote for a list that includes the names
         | of one or more candidates (up to the maximum number of Legco
         | members returned by that geographical constituency). The same
         | political party (group) may put up more than one list in a
         | constituency, and candidates on a list may belong to different
         | political party (group).
         |
         | Due to the above-mentioned change, coding for Hong Kong (2012)
         | study differs from the earlier Hong Kong studies, for the
         | variables IMD5017_.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - MEXICO: IMD5017_2
         |
         | In Mexico, each voters' vote is counted twice; once for the
         | single-member district contest, and a second time for the
         | regional PR contest. Accordingly, the voting procedure is coded
         | as voting for candidates and for a party list for each
         | respective contest. For that reason, Mexico (2003) has been
         | recoded to 2 for the variable IMD5017_2.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - MEXICO: IMD5017_3 and IMD5017_4
         |
         | In Mexico, each voters' vote for choosing senators is counted
         | twice; once for the 3-seat multi-member districts contest, and a
         | second time for the national PR contest (see Election Study note
         | for D5038_3-4 for details). Accordingly, the voting procedure is
         | coded as voting for candidates and for a party list for each
         | respective contest.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - NETHERLANDS: IMD5017_1
         |
         | A vote is always one for a list and for a candidate at the 
         | same time (matrix). A majority of voters cast their vote on 
         | the first candidate on the list. However, not all voters do
         | that. Thus, all Netherlands studies have been recoded to
         | "4. Other" for the variable IMD5017_1.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - NETHERLANDS: IMD5017_3
         |
         | Members of the Senate (Eerste Kamer) of the Dutch Parliament
         | (the States General) are elected indirectly - by the members
         | of the twelve Provincial Councils. Thus, all Dutch studies have
         | been coded "7. Not applicable" for the variable IMD5017_3.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - NORWAY: IMD5017_2
         |
         | Voters in Norway cast only one single ballot in the election on 
         | the basis of party lists. This vote directly impacts the  
         | selection of the 150 members elected in  the 19 multi-member 
         | districts using proportional representation. However, the ballot
         | also influences the dispersion of the 19 "member at large seats" 
         | (for more see D5038_2). As such, when voters are casting their 
         | ballot for party lists they are also casting a ballot, albeit 
         | indirectly for the allocation of the "member at large seats". 
         | Accordingly, we code this as "2.PARTY LISTS" for all Norway
         | studies.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - PERU: IMD5017_1
         |
         | In Peru, voters cast one vote for a party list, but they can
         | also express optionally a preferential vote for some specific
         | candidate. They can signal up to two preferred candidates from
         | the list he has chosen. The preferential votes are taken into
         | account only to decide the order in which candidates
         | from a list will fill the seats the party has won in the
         | election. Thus, Peru (2011) study has been recoded to 2 for
         | the variable IMD5017_1.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - POLAND: IMD5017_
         |
         | For the Polish 1997 election, 460 members of Polish Parliament
         | (Sejm) were elected in a two-tier system: 391 members from
         | party lists who passed a threshold of 5% of the total vote
         | (8% for registered coalitions). The remaining 69 seats were
         | reserved for parties/coalitions which (a) registered their lists
         | in at least half of the districts by collecting 3,000 valid
         | signatures in each, (b) submitted a national list of candidates,
         | and (c) gained at least 7% of the total vote. This constituted a
         | second tier.
         |
         | The new Constitution from 1997, and a change of administrative
         | divisions adopted in 1999, required a change of the electoral 
         | system. New rules were implemented for the 2001 elections.
         | One of the most important changes included final liquidation of
         | party list, and the liquidation of the second tier.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - ROMANIA: IMD5017_1 and IMD5017_3
         |
         | Romania (2009 and 2014) studies are about Presidential
         | elections. Thus, these two studies have been coded "7. Not
         | applicable" for the variable IMD5017_3.
         |
         | The remaining three Romanian studies are concerned with the 
         | Parliamentary election. Romania (1996 and 2004) studies are
         | coded "2. Party lists" because from 1992 to 2008 Romania used
         | proportional systems, closed lists, for the Upper house
         | elections. Romania (2012) study is coded "4. Other" because
         | from 2008 to 2016 Romania used mixed-member proportional
         | system - voters had two votes, one for a party, and the other for
         | candidates.
         | From 2016 the law changed again, and Romania is now back to
         | using a proportional system with closed lists.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - SLOVENIA: IMD5017_2
         |
         | In Slovenia members of Italian and Hungarian indigenous ethnic
         | communities, under the Constitution, are entitled to 2 deputy
         | seats, one seat for each community.
         | For Slovenian (1996 and 2004) studies, this was treated as second
         | segment (tier). However, members of the Italian and Hungarian
         | community, as other voters in Slovenia, cast one vote, and even
         | though they are calculated separately, they do not constitute a
         | separate tier. Thus, all Slovenia studies are recoded to "7. Not
         | applicable" in CSES IMD for IMD5017_2.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - SPAIN: IMD5017_3
         |
         | The Upper House (Senate) of Spain Parliament (Cortes Generales),
         | constitutes of 266 members. Regional legislatures designate
         | their representatives for the Senate (58 members). The remaining
         | 208 senators are directly elected.
         |
         | For the Upper House election, Spain uses single non-transferable
         | vote (limited voting), where voters have fewer votes than there
         | are positions available. Parties present a list of three names,
         | but voters cast votes for candidates. Each voter may mark up to
         | three candidates' names, from any party. Even though they are
         | allowed to give their votes to candidates from different party
         | lists (panachage) this happens rarely, and the four Senators are
         | usually the three candidates from the most popular party and the
         | first placed candidate from the next most popular.
         |
         | Thus, all Spain studies have been coded "4. Other" for the
         | variable IMD5017_3.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - SWITZERLAND: IMD5017_1
         |
         | Swiss voters can cast their vote in many different ways. Among
         | others they can a) simply vote for a party list, b) endorse
         | specific candidates from the party list, c) add candidates from
         | other parties instead of a candidate of the list (panachage),
         | d) delete candidates or vote twice for the same candidate
         | (cumulation). Due to these varieties in options for voters, all
         | Swiss studies have been coded "4. Other" for the variable
         | IMD5017_1.

         | POLITY NOTES - TAIWAN: IMD5017_2
         |
         | The electoral law in 2008 changed rules for legislative
         | elections to a mixed-member majoritarian (MMM) system, and the
         | total number of seats has been reduced to 113. Among them,
         | 73 seats are elected based on the single-member districts (SMD),
         | 34 seats based on the proportional representation (PR) in a
         | nationwide district, and 6 seats for the aboriginals.
         |
         | Previously, Legislative Yuan had 225 seats; 168 legislators from
         | the special municipalities, counties, and cities (29 such
         | primary districts); 4 seats for members of plains Aborigine
         | tribes and 4 for members of mountain Aborigine tribes, 8 seats
         | representing the overseas Taiwanese community, and 41 'at-large'
         | legislators. In case of overseas and 'at large' seats, political
         | parties are given those seats to fill, based on their percentage
         | (national) of the vote. Since Taiwanese voters cast only single
         | nontransferable vote (SNTV) the country is coded as having one
         | segment, but primary and secondary districts.
         |
         | Thus, there is a difference in coding for Taiwan studies before
         | and after 2008 change of law. Additionally, Taiwan (1996) study,
         | for the same reason, has been recoded to "7. Not applicable" for
         | the variable IMD5017_2.

         | POLITY NOTES - TAIWAN: IMD5017_3-IMD5017_4
         |
         | Constitutional amendments promulgated on April 25, 2000,
         | established a unicameral legislative system in Taiwan. Thus,
         | coding for Taiwan (1996) study from MODULE 1 differs from all
         | following Taiwan studies. For all the following studies,
         | starting from 2001 study, variables IMD5017_3 and IMD5017_4 are
         | coded "7. Not applicable."

         | Constitution reform in Chile, in 2005, eliminated all the
         | appointed seats in Senate, as well as those held by previous
         | presidents. Later reforms in 2017 made Senate in Chile a
         | 50-members body, with senators elected for an eight-year term.
         | Senate elections are held every four years for approximately
         | half the seats. All the voting for Senators happens in one round.
         | Thus, all Chile studies have been coded 1 for variable IMD5018_3.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - HONG KONG: IMD5018_
         |
         | In geographical constituency elections, there is only one round
         | of voting. Thus, all Hong Kong studies in CSES IMD have been
         | recoded to 1.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - NORWAY: IMD5018_
         |
         | Voters in Norway cast only one single ballot in the election on 
         | the basis of party lists. This vote directly impacts the  
         | selection of the 150 members elected in  the 19 multi-member 
         | districts using proportional representation. However, the ballot
         | also influences the dispersion of the 19 "member at large seats" 
         | As such, when voters are casting their ballot for party lists
         | they are also casting a ballot, albeit indirectly for the
         | allocation of the "member at large seats". However, since this
         | is a single ballot (single vote) in the same round, all Norway
         | studies have been coded 1 for IMD5018_.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BELARUS (2008): IMD5018_1
         |
         | The electoral law of 15 March 1994 Constitution (Art. 64 - 72) 
         | stipulates that Belarus has a majority/plurality electoral 
         | systems composed of 2 rounds. 
         | Parline describes that "In the first round, voting is 
         | considered valid if over 50 percent of eligible voters take 
         | part in the polls. Candidates who receive over 50 percent of
         | votes are declared elected. If none of the candidates obtains 50 
         | percent of votes, a runoff election between the two leading 
         | candidates is held within two weeks. Runoff elections are
         | considered valid if more than 25 percent of eligible voters 
         | take part. The candidate securing a simple majority of votes 
         | wins the seat. If the second round of voting is held for only
         | one candidate, the candidate needs to obtain the support of over
         | half of the voters taking part in the election.)"

         | Date accessed: August 5, 2019.
         |
         | However in the course of the election of 2008, all 110 deputies
         | were elected in the first round of voting (more than 50 % 
         | of voters took part, and each from 110 elected candidates
         | received more than 50 % of votes). Thus, the second round was 
         | not necessary in any electoral district. So the variable
         | IMD5018_1 is coded "1."

         | POLITY NOTES - JAPAN: IMD5022_1
         |
         | In the single-member districts of the Lower House contest, as
         | well as for the prefecture-level districts of the Upper House,
         | a candidate needs to obtain votes at least equal to one-sixth
         | of the quotient obtained by dividing the total of valid ballots
         | cast by the number of seats to be filled from the constituency
         | concerned. For all single-member districts of the lower house
         | contest this equals obtaining at least 1/6 (16.7%) of
         | the total valid votes. Instead, the multi-member prefecture
         | -level districts of the Upper House contest have variable
         | district magnitudes with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 5. In
         | this case, this quotient varies from 16.6% to 3.33% of the valid
         | votes.
         | This rule has been in force for all of the elections covered by
         | studies included in CSES. However, some minor differences may
         | occur due to rounding issues of statistical software packages.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - NEW ZEALAND: IMD5022_2
         |
         | New Zealand has an alternative threshold: Parties with more than  
         | 5% of the total votes nationally on the basis of the party list 
         | votes ('party vote', tier 2) or those who have won one of the 70
         | constituency seats (tier 1) are entitled to sit in parliament  
         | and may be eligible to receive a proportional share of the 50  
         | list seats on the basis of their national vote share.
         | Thus, New Zealand (2008) coded in Standalone MODULE 3 dataset "5"
         | has been recoded to 96, like the other New Zealand studies in
         | CSES.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - SOUTH AFRICA: IMD5022_1

         | The threshold applies to the nation-wide proportional district: 
         | 3% of the total valid votes for party lists, or at least 5  
         | primary district seats.
         | Thus, South Korea (2008) has been recoded to "96. OTHER
         | THRESHOLD [SEE ELECTION STUDY NOTES]."

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - CANADA (2008): IMD5022_2

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - ROMANIA (2012): IMD5022_1 & IMD5022_3
         |
         | The threshold for political parties to obtain seats is 5% of the
         | valid votes. However, it is higher for electoral alliances 
         | comprising of more parties: 
         |    - A threshold of 8% of valid votes for coalitions 
         |      of 2 parties. 
         |    - A threshold of 9% of valid votes for coalitions 
         |      of 3 parties. 
         |    - A threshold of 10% of valid votes for coalitions 
         |      of 4 parties or more. 
         | Alternatively, a party that wins six district seats in the 
         | Chamber of Deputies or three district seats in the Senate 
         | may also receive seats.

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - SOUTH AFRICA (2009): IMD5022_2

         | Next to the Legislative Yuan, Taiwan's lower house, Taiwan also 
         | had a directly elected National Assembly, which was formally 
         | abolished only in 2005. 
         | The National Assembly originally had two main powers: Electing 
         | the President and Vice President, and amending the constitution. 
         | Since 1996, President and Vice President are elected directly. 
         | As of 2000, the National Assembly was only to be elected ad hoc 
         | whenever constitutional amendments were proposed by the 
         | Legislative Yuan. Since then, the National Assembly gathered
         | only once after its direct elections in 2005, to vote on the 
         | constitutional amendment to suspend itself until a reunification 
         | with Mainland China. 
         | However, since direct elections to the National Assembly last
         | took place in 2005, Taiwan is coded as a bicameral system for
         | the Taiwanese election studies in 1996, 2001 and 2004 and as
         | a unicameral system thereafter.

         | CSES IMD includes two variables on the number of legislative 
         | chambers which build on the coding in the Standalone CSES 
         | Modules. 
         | IMD5026_1 measures whether a polity has one or two legislative
         | Chambers, no matter whether it is elected or not. 
         | IMD5026_2 distinguishes between whether the bicameral legislature
         | is directly elected by voters or partially elected by voters or 
         | indirectly elected.
         |
         | IMD5026_2 classifies the means of election of each chamber. Most 
         | unicameral systems are directly elected by citizens (although 
         | there are some exceptions to this but CSES does not classify 
         | partially elected unicameral systems). For bicameral systems, 
         | CSES classifies whether the chamber is fully directly elected by 
         | voters, partially elected, or indirectly elected. 
         |
         | Bicameral legislatures are classified as having fully directed 
         | elected chambers only if all members of the second chamber are 
         | elected by the people, based on universal suffrage.
         |
         | For more detailed information concerning the composition of first
         | and second chambers, please consult ELECTION STUDY NOTES,

         |
         | Before 2014, and applicable to all Belgian studies in the CSES
         | IMD, there were three segments in Upper House elections. Of the 
         | then 71 members of the upper house, 40 were directly elected, 21
         | were appointed by regional assemblies of the three communities 
         | (Flemish, French, German), and 10 were appointed by elected 
         | senators. The 40 members were directly elected in three multi-
         | member districts (Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels).
         | Since 2014, the Belgian Senate consists of 60 members, out of 
         | which 10 are appointed by fellow Senators, and 50 are appointed
         | by the community and regional parliaments. 

         | POLITY NOTES - CHILE: IMD5026_2
         |
         | Until 2006, and applicable to the Chilean 1999 and 2005 
         | studies in the CSES IMD, Chile's upper house - the Senate - 
         | included 38 directly elected members and 9 members who were 
         | appointed (4 by the military, 3 by the Supreme Court, and 
         | another 2 by the President). Additionally, former Presidents 
         | Augusto Pinochet and Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle held seats in the 
         | Senate (appointed for a lifetime). 
         | As of 2006, all appointed seats were abolished, and since then, 
         | the whole Senate is directly elected.  

         | POLITY NOTES - ITALY: IMD5026_2
         |
         | In Italy, 315 Senators are directly elected. However, the 
         | President has the right to appoint up to 5 (additional)
         | outstanding citizens as Senate members for a lifetime. Further, 
         | former Italian Presidents hold a seat in the Senate ex-officio.

         | POLITY NOTES - KENYA: IMD5026_2

         | Parliament of Kenya consists of two directly elected houses: 
         | The National Assembly (lower house) and The Senate (upper 
         | house).
         | The National Assembly consists of 350 representatives: 290 
         | members are elected in single-member constituencies, 47 seats
         | are awarded to women in a separate election in 47 counties, where
         | each county constitutes a single-member constituency. Further 12
         | representatives are appointed, which makes a total number of 349 
         | representatives. In addition, the Speaker of the Assembly who is
         | an ex officio member.
         | The Senate has 68 seats, of which 47 are elected from single-
         | member constituencies based on the counties using first-past-
         | the-post, and the remaining 21 are appointed; 16 women based on 
         | party's seat numbers, two representing disabled groups and two 
         | representing youth (both of which must consist of a male and 
         | female nominee) and one elected Speaker, who is an ex officio
         | member.

         | Constitutionally, the Bundestag consists of 598 seats. Half
         | of the members (299) are elected in single-member districts
         | using the first past the post electoral system (the "first
         | vote") The remaining 299 seats are filled by proportional
         | representation using the party list (the "second vote"). 
         | 
         | Until the Bundestag elections 2009, so-called overhang 
         | mandates (i.e., additional seats) were allocated to parties
         | winning more seats in single-member districts than they were
         | entitled to according to their vote share obtained by 
         | proportional representation. Thus, overhang mandates 
         | potentially changed the proportional composition of
         | parliament to the benefit of larger parties.
         |
         | Since 2013, compensatory seats are allocated to all 
         | parties not benefiting from overhang mandates.

         | This Cabinet (so-called Ponta 3 Cabinet) was in the office until
         | December 13, 2014. Following the presidential elections, the 
         | UDMR decided to leave the governing coalition because of the 
         | anti-PSD vote of the Hungarian voters. Because this involved a 
         | political change in the Cabinet parliamentary approval was 
         | sought and received on December 17, 2014.

         | The Serbian government has one Prime Minister, one or more
         | vice-ministers and ministers - they together constitute the
         | cabinet and they all have voting right. After the 2012
         | elections, the Serbian government had 19 members with voting
         | rights: one Prime Minister, four Deputy Prime Ministers, and 14
         | ministers. In the new government, the Prime Minister is also
         | Minister of Internal Affairs.

         | coalition with PUPS. SPS ended up with 4 cabinet members and URS
         | with one. Given the dominant position of SPS over URS, the
         | data includes cabinet members of both parties.

         | inconsistencies might have likely occurred because electoral

         | Canadian studies consistently. According to the Canadian 
         | collaborator, electoral alliances were allowed in Canada but
         | they just did not exist. The collaborator suspects that this

         | studies. It is coded as ‘Yes' because in theory electoral
         | alliances can be formed legally. However, in practice the
         | question is vague. There was some informal agreement which
         | enables the parties concerned to cooperate in the Election

         | During the harmonization, we found a couple of over time
         | inconsistencies. Those inconsistencies were caused by the fact
         | that for MODULE 1, category 7 (Not applicable) did not exist
         | and election studies which should have been coded as 7 were
         | coded as 5 (No). To make them consistent over time, those 
         | election studies were recoded from 5 (No) to 7 (Not 
         | applicable). This is the case for Denmark (1998), Sweden 
         | (1998), Japan (1996), Taiwan (1996), Thailand (2001) and the  
         | United States (1996).

         | In contrast with other Brazilian studies included in CSES, 
         | the 2002 Brazilian election study specified that 
         | multi-party endorsements were not permissible. Therefore, 
         | IMD5040_2 was originally coded as 7. NOT APPLICABLE in CSES 
         | MODULE 2. However, collaborators confirmed that 
         | for all Brazilian studies included in IMD, multi-party 
         | endorsements have been permissible, but were not shown on the 
         | ballot. Therefore, IMD5040_2 has been recoded to 2. NO PARTY 
         | ENDORSEMENTS ARE INDICATED ON THE BALLOT PAPER for Brazil 2002.

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - FRANCE (2002): IMD5040_2
         |
         | For the French 2002 election study, IMD5040_2 was originally 
         | coded as 3, suggesting that in case of multi-party endorsements,
         | the candidate's name appears once on the ballot, together with 
         | the names of all supporting parties. However, the French 2002 
         | study focuses on presidential elections. In case of presidential 
         | elections, ballots contain the candidate's name only, without 
         | any party endorsement. Therefore, IMD5040_2 has been recoded to
         | 2. NO PARTY ENDORSEMENTS ARE INDICATED ON THE BALLOT PAPER for
         | France 2002. 

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - GREAT BRITAIN (1997 & 2005): IMD5040_2
         |
         | For the British 1997 and 2005 election studies, IMD5040_2 was 
         | coded 5. YES, OTHER in the Standalone CSES MODULES 1 and 2. 
         | However, in Britain, candidates were permitted to put up a short
         | description of themselves on the ballot paper, which in theory 
         | might have included the label of their supporting parties. 
         | Therefore, IMD5040_2 has been recoded to 3. YES, CANDIDATE'S NAME
         | APPEARS ONCE, TOGETHER WITH THE NAMES OF ALL SUPPORTING PARTIES 
         | for Great Britain 1997 and 2005, following the British 2015
         | study.

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - IRELAND (2002): IMD5040_2
         |
         | For the Irish 2002 election study, IMD5040_2 was originally coded
         | as 1, suggesting that multi-party endorsements are not reflected
         | on the ballot paper when they occur. However, in case of multi-
         | party endorsements, the candidate's name appears once on the 
         | ballot, together with the names of all supporting parties. Hence,
         | IMD5040_2 has been recoded to 3 for Ireland 2002, in line with
         | later Irish studies included in IMD. 

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] – JAPAN (2007 & 2013): IMD5040_2
         |
         | In the Standalone CSES Modules, IMD5040_2 has been coded 
         | inconsistently for Japan. Specifically, IMD5040_1 suggested that 
         | multi-party endorsements were permissible for the 2004 House of
         | Councilors election, but not permissible for the 2007 and 2013
         | House of Councilors elections. Consequentially, IMD5040_2 was 
         | originally coded as 7. NOT APPLICABLE for the Japanese 2007 and
         | 2013 elections. According to collaborators, multi-party 
         | endorsements were permissible in all three elections, even if 
         | they were not reflected on the ballot. While some candidates 
         | endorsed by multiple parties name their party affiliation on the
         | ballot others run as independents. Therefore, IMD5040_2 has been
         | recoded to 1. NO for Japan 2007 and Japan 2013.  

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] – NEW ZEALAND (1996): IMD5040_2
         |      
         | For the New Zealand 1996 election study, IMD5040_2 was originally 
         | coded as 3, suggesting that in case of multi-party endorsements,
         | the candidate's name appears once on the ballot, together with 
         | the names of all supporting parties. However, while a candidate 
         | standing in tier 1 ('electorate vote') may have an endorsement 
         | from another party, it is usually tacit rather than direct and 
         | usually the main party of the candidate is the one that appears 
         | on the ballot paper. Therefore, IMD5040_2 has been recoded to 
         | 1. NO for New Zealand 2002, following later New Zealand studies
         | included in IMD. 

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] – PORTUGAL (2002): IMD5040_2
         | 
         | For the Portuguese 2002 election study, IMD5040_2 was originally
         | coded as 5. OTHER. However, multi-party endorsements are not 
         | permissible in Portugal. Parties might run on a joint list with 
         | a shared label, but have to register as a pre-electoral coalition
         | if they wish to do so. That joint list then shows candidates 
         | from the corresponding political parties that integrate the 
         | coalition. Therefore, IMD5040_2 has been recoded to 
         | 7. NOT APPLICABLE for Portugal 2002, following later Portuguese
         | studies included in IMD. 

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] – UNITED STATES (1996 & 2004): IMD5040_2
         | 
         | For the U.S. 1996 and 2004 election studies, IMD5040_2 was 
         | originally coded as 3 in the Standalone CSES MODULES 1 and 2, 
         | suggesting that in case of multi-party endorsements, the 
         | candidate's name appeared once on the ballot, together with 
         | the names of all supporting parties. However, nearly all of the
         | options listed in IMD5040_2 are possible in the United States,
         | with the rules varying by state. Hence, IMD5040_2 has been 
         | recoded to 5. OTHER for United States 1996 and 2004, in line with
         | the U.S. 2008 and 2012 studies.

         | [POLITY NOTES] – GREECE: IMD5041_1
         | 
         | The 2009 Greek election study was originally coded as having 
         | 2 tiers in CSES MODULE 3. However, other studies (2012/2015)
         | classified three tiers, namely: 
         | Tier 1: Members elected to parliament in 56 districts
         |         comprised of 48 multi-seat districts and 8-single
         |         member districts.          
         | Tier 2: Nationwide party list.          
         | Tier 3: A compensatory 50-seats (40-seats in 2009) awarded to 
         |         the party receiving the largest share of the popular vote
         |         nationally - known as an electoral premium. 

         | POLITY NOTES – HONG KONG: IMD5041_1
         |
         | The number of electoral tiers increased from one to two

         | POLITY NOTES – ROMANIA: IMD5041_1
         |
         | The number of electoral segments increased from one to two

         | one electoral tier. However, for these respective elections,
         | Taiwan employed two electoral segments: 
         | The first tier consisted out of 29 multi-member districts in 
         | which 168 mandates were awarded by single non-transferable vote. 
         | The second tier returned 41 seats by proportional representation
         | in a nation-wide district. Hence, data on IMD5041_1 has been 
         | recoded to 2.

IMD5044       >>> FUSED VOTE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         This indicates whether a fused vote was used for presidential and
         legislative elections. A fused vote is when a citizen casts a
         single ballot for the elections of more than one political office.
         This particular variable captures when the single ballot is for
         the presidency and the legislature. Citizens are unable to divide
         their votes among the candidates or lists of different parties.
         Split-ticket voting is expressly prohibited.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ARGENTINA (2015): IMD5044
         |
         | While voters in Argentina can cast a fused vote, Argentine
         | election law considers each election (the presidential
         | and legislative elections) to be a separate choice and thus a 
         | voter casting a fused ballot is considered to have made two 
         | individual choices. According to the Argentine collaborator,  
         | voters and can regularly do split their votes by physically
         | cutting their ballot paper in half and thus combining a 
         | vote for a presidential candidate for one party/alliance and 
         | a legislative vote for another party/alliance.

         | Voters have a single vote. However, each ballot contains a
         | presidential ticket, a closed list for Senate, and a closed 
         | list for the Lower Chamber. Each ballot must necessarily 
         | contain lists of a single party. Electors cast votes necessarily
         | (for President and two chambers) for the same party. Hence, the
         | elections results are basically identical for all three

         | in the Standalone CSES MODULES 1 and 2, respectively.
         | The Icelandic parliament has 63 seats. According to the 
         | Icelandic constitution, the sizes of the lower and upper tier 
         | for the 1999 election were not fixed. Rather, up to one fourth 
         | of seats for each constituency were eligible to be allocated at
         | the national level (tier 2), equaling 13 out of 63 seats. 
         | The remaining 50 seats were awarded in 8 multi-member districts.
         | Hence, data for Iceland 1999 has been recoded to 6.25 for 
         | IMD5045_1 (50 divided by 8).
         | For the 2003 elections, constitutional amendments reduced the

         | The Estonian parliament consists of 101 members elected via 12
         | multi-member districts. Seats are allocated across three tiers.
         | The first tier involves seats allocated by personal mandates
         | determined by Hare quota. Candidates are awarded a seat if their
         | vote surpasses the quota. Here the average district magnitude
         | value is 8.42 (101/12). The second tier is the allocation of
         | seats based on the party list. Seats are awarded to
         | parties/coalitions based on the number of times the
         | party/coalition exceeds the district's quota. The third tier is
         | compensatory seats between the national lists of
         | parties/alliances whose candidates obtained at least 5% of the
         | national vote or three candidates. As the second and third-tier
         | magnitudes vary in each election, these values (IMD5045_2 and

         | as having one electoral segment in the Standalone CSES MODULES 
         | 1 and 2. However, according to the electoral law applicable to
         | the 1998 and 2001 elections, Denmark employed two electoral 
         | segments: 
         | The first tier consisted out of 135 seats from 17 multi-member
         | constituencies, with an average district magnitude of 7.94 
         | (135 divided by 17). 
         | The second tier awarded 40 compensatory seats on a national

         | Denmark 1998 and 2002 in IMD5045_2 were corrected for the IMD.   
         |
         | The 2006 electoral reform reduced the number of multi-member

         | 
         | Data on IMD5045_2 has been coded inconsistently for Germany 
         | in the Standalone CSES Modules. Inconsistencies occur because 
         | average district magnitude in the second tier in Germany is 
         | liable to change depending on whether overhang or compensatory 
         | seats are allotted or not (see POLITY NOTES on IMD5027 for 
         | details). 
         | For Germany, IMD5045_2 reflects average district magnitude 
         | disregarding compensatory seats. Specifically, until the 1998 
         | election, the second tier returned 328 seats to the Bundestag, 
         | with separate party lists for each of the 16 Laender. Hence, the
         | value for 1998 is 20.5 (328 divided by 16). 
         | In 2002, the number of seats allocated in the second tier were 
         | reduced to 299, resulting in an average district magnitude of 
         | 18.69 (299 divided by 16), which is the value the IMD reflects

         | [POLITY NOTES] – HONG KONG: IMD5045_2
         | 
         | Hong Kong has a unicameral legislature, the Legislative Council. 
         | Since the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
         | Region (HKSAR) in 1997, a proportion of the legislative council 
         | is returned by popular geographic constituency elections; the
         | remaining seats are returned by indirect functional constituency 
         | elections, with the precise number of returned seats varying
         | over time.
         | In the Geographical Constituency (GC) election (tier 1), 
         | Hong Kong is divided into five constituencies, and voters elect 
         | candidates by universal suffrage. In the "traditional" 
         | Functional (FC) election, voter registration requires special 
         | qualifications in some FCs, such as being a registered medical 
         | practitioner or dentist for the Medical FC. 
         | In CSES MODULE 1, the traditional FCs were coded as second tier. 
         | However, since suffrage for the traditional FCs is limited, 
         | the CSES IMD regards Hong Kong as a one-tier system until the 
         | electoral reform in 2010. That reform first applicable to the 
         | 2012 election introduced an additional tier, the District Council 
         | (Second) Functional Constituency (tier 2). This segment returns

         |
         | The Estonian parliament consists of 101 members elected via 12
         | multi-member districts. Seats are allocated across three tiers.
         | The first tier involves seats allocated by personal mandates
         | determined by Hare quota. Candidates are awarded a seat if their
         | vote surpasses the quota. Here the average district magnitude
         | value is 8.42 (101/12). The second tier is the allocation of
         | seats based on the party list. Seats are awarded to
         | parties/coalitions based on the number of times the
         | party/coalition exceeds the district's quota. The third tier is
         | compensatory seats between the national lists of
         | parties/alliances whose candidates obtained at least 5% of the
         | national vote or three candidates. As the second and third-tier
         | magnitudes vary in each election, these values (IMD5045_2 and
         | IMD5045_3 respectively) are set to "999. MISSING", with the

         | house elections: 
         | The first tier returns 300 seats from single-member districts
         | by plurality, while the second tier returns 200 seats from 
         | five multi-member districts by proportional representation. 
         | Hence, IMD5045_2 has been recoded to 40.00 for Mexico 2003

              Are the votes transferable?
              Definition: In systems with preferential voting, a voter can
              express a list of preferences. For example, votes can be cast
              by putting a '1' in the column next to the voter's preferred
              candidate, a '2' beside their second favorite candidate and
              so on. Votes are counted according to the first preferences
              and any candidates who have achieved the predetermined quota
              are elected. To decide which of the remaining candidates are
              elected the votes are transferred from candidates who have
              more than the necessary number to achieve the quota and from
              the candidate with the least number of votes. An example of
              this is the election in Ireland in 2002.

         |
         | In CSES IMD, classifications of political regimes mainly rely on
         | the following decision rule as presented by Cheibub, 2007:
         | 
         | A. The system is parliamentary either (i) if there is no
         | independently (indirectly or directly) elected President or (ii)
         | if there is an independently (indirectly or directly) elected
         | President but the government is not responsible to the President.
         | B. The system is mixed either if there is an independently
         | (indirectly or directly) elected President and government is
         | responsible to the President.
         | C. The system is presidential if the government is not 
         | responsible to the elected legislature.
         |
         | NOTE: Responsibility refers to whether the survival of the
         | executive depends directly on legislature (i.e. vote of
         | confidence).
         |
         | However, researchers are advised that in a small number of 
         | cases, codings employed in IMD diverge from regime 
         | classifications as suggested by Cheibub. We detail these 
         | instances in ELECTION STUDY notes below. 
         | Further, all polities included in IMD are classified according 
         | to the above coding scheme, irrespective of their democratic 
         | status. Researchers interested in democracy ratings may
         | refer to IMD5050_ (Freedom House) or IMD5051_ (Polity IV). 
         |
         | Data on IMD5048 were originally not included in MODULE 1 and

         | POLITY NOTES - FINLAND: IMD5048
         |
         | Classifying the Finnish executive power is subject to some 
         | controversy. In the CSES Standalone Modules and in IMD, 
         | Finland is coded as 2. MIXED REGIME, although Cheibub
         | classifies it as parliamentary. 
         | Some key features of the Finnish system that distinguish
         | it from a traditional parliamentary system are that by 
         | constitution a) the President is popularly elected by direct 
         | vote for a fixed term of six years, and for no more than two 
         | consecutive terms of office; b) the President can, on 
         | recommendation of the Prime Minister, dissolve the legislature; 
         | c) the President can veto legislature, though parliament can 
         | override the presidential veto with a simple majority; and 
         | d) the President may issue decrees that have the force of law. 
         | Nonetheless, it has been argued that Finland, after 
         | constitutional reforms in the 1990s works in practice as a 
         | parliamentary system. 

         | POLITY NOTES - ICELAND: IMD5048
         |
         | The coding of Iceland on IMD5048 is subject to various
         | interpretations, with different sources providing diverging
         | assessments (DPI classifies it as parliamentary and Matt Golder 
         | considers it semi-presidential). 
         | In the CSES Standalone Modules and IMD, Iceland is classified 
         | as 1. PARLIAMENTARY REGIME, although Cheibub classifies it as 
         | semi-presidential.
         | While Iceland does have a popularly elected President, who does 
         | have powers under the Icelandic constitution to dissolve 
         | parliament, submit a bill to parliament, and exercise emergency 
         | powers, the powers exercised have varied depending on the 
         | particular person occupying the Presidency. Accordingly, the 
         | position is largely considered ceremonial. 
         | The fact that Presidential elections often go uncontested 
         | (e.g.: 2000 and 2008) highlight this. Therefore, CSES classifies 
         | Iceland as a parliamentary system.

         | [POLITY NOTES] – PORTUGAL: IMD5048
         | 
         | Portugal's regime type is coded inconsistently in the 
         | Standalone Modules 3 and 4. While the Portuguese 2009 study
         | was coded as a mixed regime, the Portuguese 2015 study was coded
         | as parliamentary. 
         | Following Cheibub (2007), Portugal is regarded as 2. MIXED 
         | REGIME in IMD, as Portugal's President is directly elected
         | and the government is accountable to both to parliament and to
         | the President (Article 190 of the constitution).

         | [POLITY NOTES] – SOUTH KOREA: IMD5048
         | 
         | South Korea's regime type is coded inconsistently in the 
         | Standalone MODULES 3 and 4. While the country is coded as  
         | parliamentary for 2008 (MODULE 3), MODULE 4 classifies it 
         | as Presidential regime. 
         | The IMD follows both Cheibub and MODULE 4 in categorizing
         | South Korea as 3. PRESIDENTIAL REGIME. Apart from the 
         | President being directly elected (Article 67 of the 
         | constitution), parliament is not empowered to remove the 
         | government from office, but may only pass a formal 
         | recommendation for removal (Article 63). Although the 
         | National Assembly may impeach ministers (Article 65), that 
         | impeachment equals a suspension, with the final decision laying 
         | with the Constitutional Court. 

         | [POLITY NOTES] - TAIWAN (2012): IMD5048
         |
         | Taiwan's regime type is coded inconsistently in the 
         | Standalone MODULES 3 and 4. While Taiwan is coded as  
         | Presidential for 2008 (MODULE 3), MODULE 4 classifies the 
         | country as a mixed regime. 
         | In IMD, Taiwan is coded as 2. MIXED REGIME, following the 
         | MODULE 4 classification, although the constitution provides 
         | for the direct election of a president. Our coding decision is
         | based on the assessment that executive Yuan is responsible to 
         | the legislative Yuan, provided that the legislative Yuan is in
         | session, its members have the right to interpolate the
         | President of the Executive Yuan, and Ministers and chairmen of
         | the Commissions of the said Yuan (Article 57 of the
         | constitution). However, the legislature cannot vote no
         | confidence in the government and can be dissolved by the
         | President.

         |
         | The most recent Polity IV dataset dates the last regime change 
         | in Israel back to 1981, the year of Israel's de-facto annexation
         | of the Golan Heights. However, previous versions of Polity IV 
         | used for CSES MODULES 3 and 4 set 1948 as the year in which 
         | Israel's last regime change occurred. CSES does not retroactively
         | update estimates as to do so might impede replication. Therefore,
         | for all Israeli election studies in the CSES IMD, IMD5049 was 
         | coded in such a way that it dates the last regime change back to
         | 1948.

         | POLITY NOTES - PERU: IMD5049
         |
         | The age of the current regime is coded 0 for both Peru 2000 
         | and Peru 2001 - reflecting the period when Peru's President 
         | Alberto Fujimori won the elections and a controversial third 
         | term in office in May 2000, but fled the country later the same 
         | year when he was charged with corruption and human rights 
         | violations. As a consequence, early Presidential elections were
         | held in spring 2001. 

         | POLITY NOTES - RUSSIA: IMD5049
         |
         | Polity IV distinguishes two recent regime changes in Russia: one  
         | in 1992 after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, meaning the 
         | the 1999 Russian study is coded 7 for this variable. The second
         | regime change was classified in 2000, meaning the 2000 Russian  
         | study is coded 0 for this variable and the 2004 Russian study 
         | is coded 4 for this variable.  
                  
         | POLITY NOTES - THAILAND: IMD5049
         |
         | Thailand has experienced several breaks with democracy in its 
         | history. Polity IV marks three regime changes. The first occurs 
         | in 1992, meaning the 2001 Thai study is coded 9 for this 
         | variable. The second regime change was classified in 2006-8, 
         | meaning the 2007 Thai study is coded 0 for this variable, and the 
         | third in 2011, meaning the 2011 Thai study is coded 0 for this 
         | variable.

         | However, aggregate level macro data from the World Bank is often

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD5058_1
         |
         | Definition based on Laakso, M. and R. Taagepera (1979)
         | '"Effective" Number of Parties: A Measure with Application to 
         | West Europe', Comparative Political Studies 12: 3-27.  
         |
         | The underlying premise of the measure is to count parties and         
         | simultaneously take account of their relative strength (i.e.,
         | their vote share). 
         |         
         | Formula: ENPP = 1/(SUM[V_i^2])
         |          where V_i represents the vote share of party i, and all
         |          parties (i=1,2...n) receiving votes are included in the
         |          calculation.
         |
         | The electoral data employed to calculate this index comes
         | from lower house elections, unless the study is focused on
         | upper house election exclusively.
         | For countries with mixed electoral systems the electoral
         | returns come from the segment containing the most seats. If
         | there are an equal amount of seats in each segment the results
         | come from the proportional representation segment.
         |
         | For MODULES 1 and 2, data was collected from:
         | Gallagher, Michael, 2019. "Election indices dataset" - see:
         | http://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/people/michael_gallagher/
         | ElSystems/index.php,        
         | (Date accessed: August 14, 2019). 
         |
         | For MODULES 3 and 4,the CSES Secretariat calculated these data
         | for each polity's election and cross-checked it against the same
         | source. 
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: Not included (See VARIABLE NOTES above)

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ARGENTINA (2015): IMD5058_1
         |
         | Calculating the effective number of electoral parties in 
         | Argentina is complex given that parties form alliances at the
         | regional level and moreover election results data is not always
         | aggregated consistently for parties/alliances. Thus, consistent
         | estimates of this metric are difficult to arrive at, something
         | which is noted by Gallagher (2017) in his estimates of the same 
         | data. CSES estimates of this metric are arrived at using the

         | The underlying premise of the measure is to count parties and         
         | simultaneously take account of their relative strength (i.e.,
         | their vote share). The CENEP differs to ENEP in its 
         | classification of the other category. CENEP corrects for the 
         | "other" category using the least component method of bounds
         | suggested by Taagepera (D2015). The method requires calculating 
         | the ENEP (D5093) twice. One method treats the "other" category 
         | as a single party and the second calculates the ENEP as if 
         | every vote in the "other" category belonged to a different

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD5059_2
         |
         | Definition based on Laakso, M. and R. Taagepera (1979):
         | '"Effective" Number of Parties: A Measure with Application to 
         | West Europe', Comparative Political Studies 12: 3-27; and  
         | Taagepera, R. (1997): 'Effective Number of Parties for 
         | incomplete Data', Electoral Studies 16: 145-151.
         |         
         | The underlying premise of the measure is to count parties and         
         | simultaneously take account of their relative strength (i.e.,
         | their parliamentary seat share).       
         | Corrected Effective Number of Parliamentary Parties (CENPP)  
         | corrects for the "other" category using the least component 
         | method of bounds suggested by Taagepera (1997). The method 
         | requires calculating the ENPP twice. The first treats 
         | the "other" category as a single party and the 
         | second is calculating the ENPP as if every seat in the "other"
         | category belonged to a different party. The CENEP is the 
         | mean of both measures.
         |
         | For Formula used to calculate ENPP see variable IMD5058_2. 
         |         
         | The electoral data employed to calculate this index comes
         | from lower house elections, unless the study is focused on
         | upper house election exclusively.
         |
         | The CSES Secretariat calculates these data for each polity's 
         | election and cross-checks it against the standard source, 
         | namely:

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ARGENTINA (2015): IMD5059_2
         |
         | Calculating the effective number of parliamentary parties in 
         | Argentina is complex given that parties form alliances at the
         | regional level and moreover election results data is not always
         | aggregated consistently for parties/alliances. Thus, consistent
         | estimates of this metric are difficult to arrive at, something
         | which is noted by Gallagher (2017) in his estimates of the same 
         | data. CSES estimates of this metric are arrived at using the 
         | following approach: 
         |    - Parties and alliances are treated as one party/grouping.
         |    - All parties represented in the Chamber of Deputies post the
         |      2015 elections are included in the count, including parties 
         |      /groupings that held holdover seats but did not contest/or
         |      win additional Chamber of Deputy seats in 2015. 
         |    - The number of parties/alliances represented in the Chamber 
         |      of Deputies after the 2015 elections is estimated by our
         |      count to be 28. This is treating for the most part parties/

         | The Manifesto Project (MARPOR/CMP) provides the scientific
         | community with parties' policy positions derived from a content
         | analysis of parties' electoral manifestos. It covers over 1000
         | parties from 1945 until today in over 50 countries on five
         | continents. The DFG-funded MARPOR/CMP project continues the work
         | of the Manifesto Research Group (MRG) and the Comparative
         | Manifestos Project (CMP). 
         |

         | When the data at the time of processing of Standalone Modules
         | was unavailable, but has since become available, this has
         | been included in CSES IMD. 
         |         
         | Users are advised that CSES and MARPOR/CMP sometimes classify          
         | coalitions differently in elections and across polities. For         
         | example CSES sometimes has data solely on coalitions and not 
         | the parties comprising the alliance, while MARPOR/CMP may have 
         | data concerning the individual parties in the coalition, or 
         | vice versa. Consequently, some parties may have multiple 
         | identifiers within the MARPOR/CMP dataset across time. A non          
         | comprehensive list of these deviations are noted in Part 5  
         | of the CSES IMD Codebook in POLITY NOTES.
