))) IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING PHASE 3 RELEASE OF THE CSES INTEGRATED 
    MODULE DATASET (IMD)
===========================================================================

This dataset and all accompanying documentation comprises the Phase 3 
Release of the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD). 

The CSES Integrated Module Dataset is being released in a phased way. Thus, 
this release is an advance version of the dataset, and thus lacks some of
the checking, documentation, and inclusion of certain variables that are 
expected with the Full Release of this dataset. 

This Phase 3 Release is provided as a service to the CSES user community,
for those analysts who find it valuable to work with preliminary versions
of the dataset. We would appreciate being notified of any errors in the
dataset or documentation by email to "cses@umich.edu".

Users should expect future changes and improvements to the data and
documentation of variables. If users wish to re-use their programming code 
on a future release of the file, the code should be written in a way that 
is flexible and can be accommodating of these future changes.

Users of the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD) may wish to monitor the 
errata for CSES IMD on the CSES website, to check for known errors which 
may impact their analyses. To view errata for CSES IMD Phase 3, go to 
Data Download on the CSES website, navigate to the CSES IMD download page, 
and click on the Errata link in the white box to the right of the page.

Users of the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD) are also advised that 
while the CSES IMD Codebook is comprehensive, users are strongly advised
to consult Standalone CSES Module Documentation including Standalone CSES  
Module Codebooks, Macro Reports, Design Reports, and Election Summaries.


===========================================================================
))) OVERVIEW OF "CODEBOOK PART 1: CSES IMD - INTRODUCTION"
===========================================================================

Part 1 of the CSES IMD Codebook provides users with information about how
to use the CSES IMD Codebook and Data, including the conventions adopted in 
the CSES IMD Codebook and how to load the data into various programs. 
Moreover, we provide an overview of all the national election studies 
included in CSES IMD, as well as CSES conventions concerning identification

))) THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF ELECTORAL SYSTEMS (CSES) PROJECT OVERVIEW
===========================================================================

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES PROJECT PROFILE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) is a collaborative
program of research among election study teams from around the world.
Participating countries include a standard module of survey questions
in their post-election studies. The resulting data are deposited along
with voting, demographic, district, and macro variables. The studies are
then merged into a single, free, public dataset for use in comparative
study and cross-level analysis.

The CSES project focuses on respondents' behavior and attitudes during 
the time of a national election, with a particular emphasis on voting and 
turnout. Each CSES Module consists of a nationally-representative 
post-election survey and additional variables about the context of the 
overall country and electoral system within which the respondents find 
themselves. Every five years, a new CSES Module is designed with a 
different substantive theme selected to address essential questions 
in electoral studies and social science. 

As of 2016, four modules have been completely fielded. They are: 
 - MODULE 1: THE IMPACT OF ELECTORAL INSTITUTIONS ON CITIZENS' POLITICAL 
             COGNITION AND BEHAVIOR (1996-2002)
 - MODULE 2: THE LOGIC OF ELECTIONS AND CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT AND COGNITION
 - MODULE 3: "MEANINGFUL CHOICES" - CONDITIONS WHERE ELECTIONS PROVIDE A 
             MEANINGFUL CHOICE SET TO VOTERS (2006-2011)
 - MODULE 4: DISTRIBUTIONAL POLITICS, SOCIAL PROTECTION, AND 
             POLITICAL MOBILIZATION (2011-2016)

An international committee of leading scholars of electoral politics and 
political science develop the research agenda, questionnaires, and study 
design. The design is implemented in each country by their foremost 
social scientists. By collaborating in this way, the CSES community hopes 
to forward scientific inquiry into the relationship between electoral
institutions and political behavior.

The work of the CSES Secretariat is funded by the American National 
Science Foundation, the GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social 
Sciences, and the University of Michigan's Center for Political Studies. 

The project also receives in-kind support from participating election 
studies, additional organizations that sponsor planning committee 
meetings and conferences, and the many organizations that fund national 
election studies that participate in CSES. 

This product, the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD), brings together all 
four completed modules into one unified and harmonized data product. More 
specific information about this data product is available in the section: 
"CSES INTEGRATED MODULE DATASET (IMD): PRODUCT OVERVIEW" below.

))) CSES INTEGRATED MODULE DATASET (IMD): PRODUCT OVERVIEW
===========================================================================

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES INTEGRATED MODULE DATASET (IMD) STUDY DESCRIPTION - ABSTRACT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD) brings together the existing  
Standalone CSES Modules (CSES Modules 1-4 inclusive, all cross-section 
cases and variables for select questions) into one longitudinal and
harmonized dataset. This data product has been created by the CSES 
Secretariat.

The dataset includes over 281,000 individual-level observations, 174 
elections across 55-polities and allows exploration of electoral behavior 
across 20-years, three decades, and two centuries. All data included in the 
CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD) was collected between 1996 and 2016 
and is available in the Standalone CSES Modules. 

Variables that appear in at least three Standalone CSES Modules, up to and
including CSES Module 5, are eligible for inclusion in IMD with all
polities ever having run a CSES Module also included in the dataset. All
variables in CSES IMD are harmonized, allowing for longitudinal analysis. 

The CSES IMD offers several unique innovations to CSES users including: 
   - Harmonization of party codes within countries across modules 
   - Harmonization of administrative variables 
   - Pre-coded incumbent vote choice variable
   - In-data labels for parties and candidates 
   - A host of Data Bridging Identifiers at the polity, regional 
     and party/coalition  level allowing straightforward linkage with a 
     range of other comparative datasets 
   - Extensive checking of all CSES data 

More information regarding the CSES IMD can be found in the Comparative 
Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) Integrated Module Dataset (IMD) Stimulus
Paper available on the CSES website.

>>> THE ROAD TO CSES IMD
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the CSES Planning Committee (PC) Meeting in Seattle in October 2015, the 
PC mandated the CSES Secretariat to devise a Strategic Plan for the 
creation of a unified CSES data product including harmonization of party 
code variables. 
In November 2017, upon delivery by the Secretariat of the Strategic Plan to 
the Module 5 PC Meeting in Mannheim, the PC mandated the Secretariat to 
create an integrated harmonized data product encompassing CSES data from 
all modules to be known as the CSES Integrative Module Dataset (IMD). 

Previously, Giebler, Lichteblau, May, Melcher, Wagner & Wessels (2016) 
from the WZB made a user contribution to the CSES Website by creating the 
first publicly available cumulative CSES dataset which brought together 
CSES Modules 1-3 in one dataset and connected several variables of interest 
to scholars over time in a unified way for the first time.

>>> CSES IMD CODEBOOK OVERVIEW
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The primary component of documentation for this data product is the CSES 
IMD Codebook. The CSES IMD Codebook consists of five components, namely: 

1) PART 1: CSES IMD - INTRODUCTION 
   (file name: csesIMD_codebook_part1_introduction.txt)
   Part 1 (This file) overview of the CSES study and data, information
   about how to use the files, election study descriptions, information on
   the CSES IMD datafile, the checks the CSES Secretariat conducts on the 
   datafile and information on the CSES Planning Committees that oversaw 
   the development of CSES IMD. 

2) PART 2: CSES IMD - VARIABLES DESCRIPTION
   (file name: csesIMD_codebook_part2_variables.txt)
   Part 2 is the variable description file and includes the survey 
   questions, code frames, general notes, election study notes, and 
   details about sources for macro data. 

3) PART 3: CSES IMD - PARTIES/COALITIONS - NUMERICAL CODES HARMONIZED BY
           POLITY 
   (file name: 
   csesIMD_codebook_part3_parties_coalitions_numerical_codes.txt)
   Part 3 details the harmonized party/coalition numerical codes for each 
   polity across all modules included in the CSES IMD dataset. 

4) PART 4: CSES IMD - PARTIES/COALITIONS & LEADERS - ALPHABETICAL 
   (RELATIONAL) CODES BY POLITY BY MODULE 
   (file name: csesIMD_codebook_part4_parties_coalitions_leaders_
   alphabetical_codes.txt)
   Part 4 details the party/coalition and leader alphabetical
   (relational) codes assigned for each polity in each module in the CSES
   IMD dataset. Users are advised that alphabetical codes for 
   parties/coalitions and leaders can change between modules.

5) PART 5: CSES IMD - BRIDGING IDENTIFIERS WITH OTHER COMPARATIVE PROJECTS
   (file name: csesIMD_codebook_part5_data_bridging_identifiers.txt)
   Part 5 details the data bridging identifiers for four comparative 
   projects, namely the MARPOR Manifesto Project, ParlGov, Chapel Hill
   Expert Surveys (CHES), and Party Facts database. These identifiers are 
   included for all parties/coalitions (where applicable) included in the
   relational data component of the CSES and enables straightforward 
   linkage with these other datasets. 


The Standalone CSES Module Questionnaires are available from the CSES 
website - please consult the original study webpages. For all election 
studies included in CSES, collaborators have provided documentation to 
accompany their election studies. These documents, where available, can be 
found on the Standalone CSES Module study pages. 

Analysts will also want to become familiar with the CSES IMD errata
page. It is accessible from the CSES IMD download page under "Data
Center" on the CSES website. Information, updates, and error notifications
and corrections are posted there, in real-time, as they become available.
Please regularly check for errata notifications to keep up to date.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES IMD CODEBOOK CONVENTIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CSES project uses American English language and date standards 
(MM-DD-YYYY). In the CSES Integrated Module dataset, all variables begin 
with the letters "IMD" (IMD standing for the Integrated Module Dataset). 

Variables are presented in five groupings:

1) IMD1001-IMD1999 Identification, weight, and election study variables

2) IMD2001-IMD2999 Demographic data and variables

3) IMD3001-IMD3999 Micro-level (survey) data and variables

4) IMD5001-IMD5099 Macro-level data and variables 

5) IMD5100-IMD5199 Data Bridging identifier variables

In the Variable Descriptions section of the CSES IMD Codebook (Part 2), 
the headers for individual variables are surrounded by two lines of dashes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES IMD CODEBOOK - VARIABLE NOTES, POLITY NOTES, & ELECTION STUDY NOTES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> VARIABLE NOTES

Variable notes provide information on the rationale of a variable 
as well as source information for that variable. It also details the 
polities for which no data for that particular variable are available. 
VARIABLE NOTES are listed below the descriptive information for the said
variable and can be navigated in the CSES IMD Codebook by searching for 
"VARIABLE NOTES" in Part 2 of the CSES IMD Codebook. 


<<>> POLITY NOTES AND ELECTION STUDY NOTES

A unique dimension of the CSES are the inclusion of POLITY NOTES and
ELECTION STUDY NOTES. They are notes which are attached to each 
variable included in the dataset and refer to case-specific 
information regarding a particular variable. This information
may apply to a polity consistently in the dataset (i.e.: a POLITY NOTE)
or one election study in the dataset (i.e.: an ELECTION STUDY NOTE). 
Their purpose is to provide users with more detailed information on the 
case or explain essential deviations specific to cases from CSES 
conventions. 

They can be navigated in the Codebook by searching for "POLITY NOTES" or
"ELECTION STUDY NOTES" in Parts 2-5 of the CSES IMD Codebook.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES IMD - ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

All election studies included in CSES provide numerous source materials. 
These documents include the following: 
      - Macro reports 
      - Design reports
      - Original questionnaires including the language of origin

We describe each in turn below.

<<>> MACRO REPORT

Collaborators submit a macro report to the CSES Secretariat when depositing
their national data. Its purpose is to provide a coherent link between 
national level specialists and data specific to the election and polity 
in question. It provides information on the election, the composition of 
cabinet before and after the election, expert assessments of the parties, 
information on electoral rules operating in the polity, as well as original
sources for the country level data. It aids the CSES Secretariat in 
collating some of the macro level data for each polity included in the 
country. Where available, macro reports can be found on the Standalone
CSES Module download pages. 

<<>> DESIGN REPORT

Collaborators also submit a design report to the CSES Secretariat when 
depositing their national data. It provides all information on the 
implementation of each individual election study, including details
regarding fieldwork dates, mode of interview, sampling procedures, 
sampling frame, response and refusal rates, information on translation
procedures, and weights. Some of this data is included directly in the
CSES data in variables IMD1001-IMD1999. Where available, design reports can
be found on the Standalone CSES Module download pages. 

<<>> ORIGINAL QUESTIONNAIRES

Where available, CSES provides the original language questionnaires from 
each polity's national election study. Further, CSES requests that all 
studies included provide the English language questionnaire used as the 
basis for translation of the CSES questionnaire into a polity's native
tongue(s). Where available, the questionnaires can be found on the 
Standalone CSES Module download pages. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

>>> CSES CONVENTION OF PARTIES/COALITION CODING IN STANDALONE CSES MODULES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CSES coding convention for parties and coalitions in Standalone CSES 
Modules involves a dual coding scheme for these data, namely a numerical 
classification and an alphabetical classification. All parties/coalitions 
in the data received a numerical code (allocation of which was in part 
random, part deliberate depending on the parties/coalitions performance in 
the election). Meanwhile, the six most popular parties/coalitions received 
an alphabetical code (A-F), along with some supplementary parties/
coalitions (G-I), which are linked to relational data for that party/
coalition (e.g., party likability). Consequently, allocation of numerical 
codes for parties/coalitions are module-specific and thus within the 
Standalone CSES Modules are not consistent within countries across time. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES CODING OF PARTY/COALITIONS AND LEADERS IN CSES IMD - A NEW 
    DEPARTURE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> CSES IMD NUMERICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING - HARMONIZATION

CSES IMD marks a radical new departure in the CSES approach to the coding  
of parties and coalitions. All parties/coalitions or presidential 
candidates, where applicable, participating in the election or the previous
election receive a NUMERICAL code. These codes are used to identify the 
following in the micro-component of the CSES dataset: 

   - who the respondent voted for in the current election (IMD3002). 
   - who the respondent voted for in the previous election (IMD3004).
   - the respondent's party identification (IMD3005_3).

These codes are used to identify the following in the macro-component of
the CSES dataset:

   - Party/coalition of the prime minister before and after the election 
     (IMD5008_)
   - Party/coalition of the president before and after the election 
     (IMD5009_)

In CSES IMD, each party/coalition receives a unique numerical identifier 
that is consistent across modules. This seven-digit numerical identifier 
contains information on the polity and a unique numerical value to 
distinguish the party/coalition. Hence, numerical party/coalition codes 
are harmonized across Modules within CSES IMD. 

The first three digits of the identifier consist of the three-digit UN 
Polity Identifier Code. The remaining four digits consist of numerical 
codes ranging from 0001 to 9999, with each party/coalition assigned a value 
that remains consistent across Modules.   
In assigning of the last four digits, macro data specialists have assigned 
codes with consistent leading vote-getters in a polity being assigned lower 
values. Beyond this, the allocation of the final four digits is random. 

The harmonized and consistent codes for parties/coalitions are detailed
in Part 3 of the CSES IMD Codebook. Users can search for the 
following term: "CSES IMD HARMONIZED PARTY/COALITION NUMERICAL CODES"


<<>> CSES IMD NUMERICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING - IMPORTANT NOTES

In cases of a merger between two parties, the newly created party/coalition
receives a different numerical code from its previous incarnations. 

When parties compete in electoral alliances/coalitions, the 
alliance/coalition receives a different numerical code from the constituent 
parties that make it up. 

Parties/coalitions that merely undergo a name change do not receive a new 
unique code. Instead, a POLITY/ELECTION STUDY NOTE will note the name
change. 


<<>> CSES IMD ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING - RELATIONAL DATA

CSES IMD includes relational data for parties/coalitions. In CSES IMD, as 
in Standalone CSES Modules, this data is coded using an ALPHABETICAL 
classification with parties/coalitions where data is available receiving 
an alphabetical code (A-I). 

Parties/coalition A through F are the six most popular parties/coalitions, 
ordered in descending order of their share of the popular vote in the said
polity's election (unless otherwise stated). Thus Party A is the 
party/coalition  that received the most votes in the election, party B the 
second most votes, etc...         
Parties/coalitions who achieve at least 1% of the vote nationally are 
eligible for an alphabetical A-F assignment. In countries with multiple 
electoral tiers and where one vote is cast, parties are ordered according
to their vote share in tier 1 (the lowest tier), unless otherwise stated. 
In countries where voters have two votes (i.e., a constituency and a list  
vote) simultaneously, for example Germany, parties are ordered by the 
national share of the party list vote (tier 2).

Parties G, H, and I are supplemental parties. They may, but do not have to,
accord with how parties A-F are ordered, that is ordered on the popular 
share of the vote in a country. More often, they are codified in no 
particular order. These parties are voluntarily provided by each polity's
election study and often reflect important or notable parties within a 
polity. They may also include data about individual parties within a 
coalition, where data about the coalition and the individual parties, 
or some of these parties that make it up, are provided.

These codes are used to identify the following in the micro-component of 
the CSES dataset: 

   - Respondent's left-right placement of the party/coalition 
     (variable IMD3007).
   - Respondent's likability of the party/coalition (variable IMD3008). 

These alphabetical codes are used to identify the distinct and macro level 
information about these said parties/coalitions, namely:

   - Election Results: percentage of vote for each party/coalition in lower
     house (variable IMD5001_)
   - Election Results: percentage of seats for each party/coalition in 
     lower house (variable IMD5002_)
   - Election Results: percentage of vote for each party/coalition in upper
     house (variable IMD5003_)
   - Election Results: percentage of seats for each party/coalition in 
     upper house (variable IMD5004_)
   - Election Results: percentage of vote for each party/coalition in 
     presidential election (variable IMD5005_)
   - Expert judgments by the national collaborators of the said party/
     coalition's ideological family placement (variable IMD5011_).
   - Expert judgments by the national collaborators of the said party/
     coalition's left-right placement (variable IMD5012_).
   - Number of cabinet portfolios held by each party/coalition before the 
     election (variable IMD5029_).
   - Number of cabinet portfolios held by each party/coalition after the 
     election (variable IMD5031_).     

To allow users to see what party/coalition A-I refers to in a particular 
election within a polity, variable IMD5000 provides identifiers within
the dataset with detailed labels. In addition, Part 4 of the CSES IMD 
Codebook details the alphabetical classifications for each polity by 
Standalone CSES Module. Users can search in Part 4 of the CSES IMD 
Codebook with the following term: "ALPHABETICAL PARTY CODES BY CSES MODULE"


<<>> CSES ALPHABETICAL LEADER CODING

CSES IMD includes relational data for leaders of parties/coalitions. In 
CSES IMD, as in Standalone CSES Modules, this data is coded using an
ALPHABETICAL classification with leaders where data is available receiving 
an alphabetical code (A-I). 

Leaders A through F tends to be the leaders of the six most popular 
parties/coalitions or the presidential candidates of these parties. They 
correspond to parties A-F (i.e., Leader A will be related to Party A in 
some way, Leader B will be related to Party B, etc...) 

Leaders G, H, and I are supplemental leaders. They may be related to 
parties G, H, I, but they do not have to be. These leaders are voluntarily
provided by each country's election study and often include data about
additional personalities of interest. For example, in a parliamentary 
system, data about a President might be provided, even if the Presidency 
is not being contested. On many occasions, slots for Leader G, H, and I  
will include additional data for parties/coalitions that have multiple 
leaders. These codes are used to identify the following in the micro and  
macro components of the CSES dataset: 

   - Respondent's likability of the leader/personality in question 
     (variable IMD3009). 

To allow users to see what Leader A-I refers to in a particular 
election within a polity, Part 4 of the CSES IMD Codebook details the 
alphabetical classifications of leaders for each polity by Standalone CSES 
Module. Users can search in Part 4 of the CSES IMD Codebook with the 
following term: "ALPHABETICAL LEADER CODES BY CSES MODULE"


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES DATA BRIDGING: NEW FRONTIERS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data Bridging enables users to bring together information from CSES with 
other data sources. The concept is part of CSES Data Linkage efforts. CSES
has been a pioneer of Data Linkage with the inclusion of various 
macro-level data originating from other sources (e.g., The World Bank, 
the IDEA) directly in CSES data products, including in CSES IMD. These 
macro data classify the political system's characteristics and contextual 
conditions of a polity at the election time.  
Data Bridging gives users the power to build on the direct data linkage 
in CSES products by enabling users to easily link other data with CSES 
products. CSES IMD enables users to bridge data with other prominent 
datasets in political science by including standard identifiers at the
polity, year, and party level used by other projects to facilitate 
merging.

CSES IMD facilitates data bridging with other datasets at the polity level
with the following variables:
    - IMD1006_UN       ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN ISO_3166-1 NUMERIC CODE
    - IMD1006_UNAlpha2 ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN ISO_3166-1 ALPHABETIC
                                      TWO LETTER CODE
    - IMD1006_NAM      ID COMPONENT - POLITY NAME
    - IMD1006_VDem     ID COMPONENT - V-Dem POLITY IDENTIFIER
    
More details can be found on all these variables in CSES IMD Codebook 
Part 2 by searching for the variable name (e.g., "IMD1006_UN") or using
the search term "POTENTIAL POLITY LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER". 

CSES IMD facilitates data bridging with other datasets at the regional 
level through the following variables:  
    - IMD1006_REG      ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS NUMERIC
                                      CODES
More details can be found on all these variables in CSES IMD Codebook 
Part 2 by searching for the variable name (e.g., "IMD1006_UN") or using
the search term "POTENTIAL REGIONAL LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER". 

CSES IMD facilitates data bridging with other datasets by date through the
following variables:  
    - IMD1008_YEAR     ID COMPONENT - ELECTION YEAR
    - IMD1011_1        DATE 1ST ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - YYYY-MM-DD
    - IMD1011_2        DATE 1ST ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - YYYYMM
    - IMD1012_1        DATE 2ND ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - YYYY-MM-DD
    - IMD1012_2        DATE 2ND ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - YYYYMM                                      

More details can be found on all these variables in CSES IMD Codebook 
Part 2 by searching for the variable name (e.g., "IMD1008_YEAR") or using
the search term "POTENTIAL REGIONAL LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER". 

CSES IMD facilitates data bridging with other datasets at the party/ 
coalition level with the following variables: 
    - IMD5100_A-I      MANIFESTO RESEARCH ON POLITICAL REPRESENTATION 
                       (MARPOR/CMP) IDENTIFIER - PARTY A-I
    - IMD5101_A-I      PARLIAMENTS AND GOVERNMENT DATABASE (PARLGOV) 
                       IDENTIFIER - PARTY A-I
    - IMD5102_A-I      CHAPEL HILL EXPERT SURVEY (CHES) IDENTIFIER -
                       PARTY A-I
    - IMD5103_A-I      PARTY FACTS IDENTIFIER - PARTY A-I

Part 2 by searching for the variable name (e.g., "IMD5100_A") or using
the search term "POTENTIAL PARTY/COALITION BRIDGING IDENTIFIER."
can also see the specific bridging codes for each party/coalition assigned
an alphabetical code in CSES by other projects in Part 5 of the CSES 
IMD Codebook.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> PLACEMENT OF QUESTIONS IN CSES IMD AND STANDALONE CSES MODULES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using variables in the CSES IMD, users are advised that even when a
question is worded identically in successive surveys, its placement in the
survey questionnaire may be different in each Standalone CSES Module, with
unknown effects. Thus, even when a question is worded identically in 
successive surveys, analysts may wish to examine the placement of the 
question in each questionnaire to ensure that changes in its placement do 
not contaminate analyses. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> RECODING OF VARIABLES FOR CSES IMD
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variables for CSES IMD have been recoded to be consistent over time. 
Questions (and variables) are not necessarily coded the same way in CSES
IMD as they are in the Standalone CSES Modules. Users are advised to 
consult the CSES IMD Codebook Part 2, where possible, details have been
provided in VARIABLE NOTES and ELECTION STUDY NOTES regarding harmonization
schemes and specific election study deviations. Users are also advised to 
have to consult Standalone CSES Module Codebook for specific information on
Module-specific studies. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> DEVIATIONS FROM STANDALONE CSES MODULES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CSES goal is to keep deviations between Standalone CSES Modules and  
CSES IMD to a minimum. Nonetheless, despite question wordings being  
virtually identical across CSES modules, CSES IMD harmonizes variables to  
be consistent over time, thus necessitating some deviations to occur. 
These deviations may occur because of coding errors found in the 
Standalone CSES dataset or Standalone Codebooks. In these circumstances, 
these errors may result in changes being implemented in CSES IMD 
and the issues listed in errata on the Standalone CSES Module pages. These 
issues will be corrected in the Standalone CSES Modules upon re-release of 
these respective Standalone CSES Modules at some future date. 

Deviations may also legitimately arise because of different coding schemes 
applied in Standalone CSES Modules compared with CSES IMD, lack of data at 
the time of processing of Standalone CSES Modules which has since become 
available, or that data for certain variables were not collected in 
particular Standalone CSES Modules but have become eligible for inclusion 
in CSES IMD as it meets the 3 and 1 eligibility criteria.

In line with the policy of minimizing differences between CSES IMD and 
Standalone CSES Modules, CSES only applies deviations between CSES IMD and 
Standalone CSES Modules when the above circumstances are met. In 
circumstances where CSES is unable to explain why coding differs between 
studies from the same polity over time, no changes are made to the data. 

Concerning deviations, Election Study Notes and Polity Notes are included 
under the applicable variables noting the deviations. Irregular codes 
discovered in Standalone CSES Modules and which could not  
be identified were set to missing. These are also noted in Variable Notes
and Election Study Notes. Users can identify these by using the following
unique search term in Part 2 of the CSES IMD Codebook: 
   - VARIABLE NOTES
   - [POLITY NOTES]
   - [ELECTION STUDY NOTES]


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> DERIVATIVE VARIABLES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSES IMD includes several derivative variables. A derivative variable is a
variable that is derived from another variable or variable within the CSES.
Their purpose is to facilitate speedier analysis for users with derivative
variables capturing some of the most common analytical concepts in the
discipline.

A list of the DERIVATIVE VARIABLES are below this explanation and can be
navigated in the Codebook by searching for DERIVATIVE VARIABLES in
Part 2 of the CSES IMD Codebook.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> IDENTIFICATION VARIABLES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several identification variables in CSES IMD which allow
users to not only identify an individual respondent, but election studies, 
and polities. 

<<>> ELECTION STUDY IDENTIFIERS

Each Election Study in CSES IMD is uniquely identified by two variables, 
namely: 

   - variable IMD1003 ID VARIABLE - ELECTION STUDY (NUMERIC POLITY)
     This variable is an eight-digit numerical code constructed from two
     components: the CSES polity code (variable IMD1006) and the 
     year in which the election took place (IMD1008). The first three 
     digits represent the country codes assigned by the United Nations 
     Statistics Division. The fourth digit distinguishes between multiple 
     election studies within a single country for the same election. 
     The final four digits represent the year of the election. 
     E.g., 03602013. AUSTRALIA (2013)

   - variable IMD1004 ID VARIABLE - ELECTION STUDY (ALPHABETIC POLITY)
     This variable is an alphanumerical code constructed from two
     components: the alpha-3 country codes assigned by the United Nations
     Statistics Division. The remaining characters correspond 
     to the year of the election. 
     E.g., USA_2012


<<>> POLITY IDENTIFIERS

Each Polity in CSES IMD is uniquely identified by three variables, namely: 

   - variable IMD1006_UN ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN ISO_3166-1 NUMERIC CODE
     This variable consists of the three digit numeric country codes 
     assigned by the United Nations Statistics Division to polities
     in line with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
     The numerical codes are maintained by the United Nations Statistics 
     Division and are based on the M49 UN framework. 
     E.g., 372. IRELAND (2011)

   - variable IMD1006_UNAlpha2 ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN ISO_3166-1 
     ALPHABETIC TWO LETTER CODE
     This variable consists of the two-letter country codes assigned by 
     the United Nations Statistics Division to polities based on the 
     International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The lettered
     codes are maintained by the ISO as part of their ISO3166-1 standard. 
     E.g., DE. Germany (DE=Deutschland)

   - variable IMD1006_NAM ID COMPONENT - POLITY NAME
     This variable consists of polity names based on those used by the
     United Nations Statistics Division. 
     E.g., New Zealand 


<<>> POLITY GEOGRAPHIC IDENTIFIERS

   - variable IMD1006_REG ID COMPONENT - GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS UN
     This variable consists of a two digit numeric codes assigned by the
     United Nations Statistics Division to polities based on their 
     geographic (continental) region. Each polity is shown in one 
     region only. 


<<>> POLITY MEMBERSHIP IDENTIFIERS

CSES IMD classifies whether each polity was a member of two international
organizations at the time of the election, namely the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the European Union (EU). 

   - variable IMD1006_OECD ID COMPONENT - POLITY MEMBER OF OECD
     This variable classifies whether polity was a member of the 
     Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) at the
     time of the election. 

   - variable IMD1006_EU ID COMPONENT - POLITY MEMBER OF EU
     This variable classifies whether polity was a member of the European
     Union at the time of the election. 


<<>> RESPONDENT IDENTIFIER

Respondents can be uniquely identified in the dataset by variable IMD1005. 
It is an 18-character identifier. The first three characters are the 
numeric version of the country codes assigned by the United Nations 
Statistics Division. The next four characters denote the year of the
election. The remaining characters constitute the respondent ID within that
particular election study (which is also equivalent to variable 
IMD1008_RES).


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> MISSING DATA
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multiple response categories can relate to missing data relating from 
not applicable to a respondent refusing to answer or failing to answer 
a question. Users should consult individual variables for the specific
missing designations assigned to each variable. 

For some election studies in which we could not distinguish among various
answers, the code "missing" may include cases where respondents refused 
to answer the question, "don't know" responses, and cases where there
a particular question went unanswered for other reasons.

Moreover, while CSES guidelines request that the response categories 
"Refused" and "Don't Know" be volunteered responses, this was not always 
consistently applied. For instance, sometimes the options were offered 
explicitly to respondents in mail-back surveys, which do not have the 
benefit of an interviewer being present. To identify whether the response 
options were volunteered (or not) in a particular election study, users 
should refer to the original questionnaires of each country. These are
available on the Standalone CSES Module pages.

While there is no consistent CSES convention regarding the application of
missing values, some commonalities exist, namely: 
- Not applicable values are commonly designated as 7, 97, 997, 9997, etc...
- Don't know values are commonly designated as 8, 98, 998, 9998, etc... 
- Missing values are commonly designated as 9, 99, 999, 9999, etc...

However, users are advised that the commonalities do not always hold,
and they are advised to consult individual variables for the specific
missing designations assigned to the variable in question. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> WEIGHTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSES IMD provides users with up to three original weights from each 
national election study (see variable IMD1010_) namely:

  - ELECTION STUDY SAMPLE WEIGHT (variable IMD1010_1): 
    intended to correct for unequal selection probabilities resulting from 
    booster samples procedures for selection within the household, 
    non-response, or other sample design features 

  - ELECTION STUDY DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT (variable IMD1010_2): 
    intended to adjust sample distributions of socio-demographic 
    characteristics to more closely resemble the characteristics of the 
    population

  - ELECTION STUDY POLITICAL WEIGHT (variable IMD1010_3): 
    intended to reconcile discrepancies in the reported electoral behavior
    of respondents vis-a-vis official electoral counts. 

For more information on polity weights, users are advised to consult the 
Standalone CSES Module Codebooks. 

Analysts are advised to read the weight documentation carefully to ensure
that their analyses are weighted appropriately (if applicable). The CSES 
project does not provide advice as to which weights are appropriate to 
use in particular circumstances. This is best left to analysts to decide 
based on their detailed knowledge of the research question under
investigation. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> FREEDOM STATUS OF ELECTIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The majority of studies that comprise CSES are collected in countries that
have free or partly free elections. However, sometimes a collaborator will
include the CSES module in a study of a polity that is a developing
democracy or that is considered not free. If the data collection is judged
to be of sufficiently high quality, the study is included in CSES datasets
even if the country is considered to be not free. The decision regarding
inclusion of particular polities in an analysis is thus left to users. 

To assist users in making appropriate decisions concerning their 
analysis, CSES IMD includes two measures about the freedom 
and liberty of a polity in the year the election was held (and indeed
the two preceding years), namely: 

   - FREEDOM HOUSE RATING (variables IMD5050)
     Freedom House assigns a numerical rating of a polity on a scale of 
     1 to 7 providing an indication of freedom. 

   - POLITY IV DEMOCRACY-AUTOCRACY RATING (variables IMD5051)
     Polity IV assigns a numerical rating to a polity on a scale of -10 
     to 10 indicating whether the country is strongly democratic or
     strongly autocratic. 

Freedom House and Polity IV are not affiliated with the CSES project.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> PROCESSING CHECKS OF INTEGRATED MODULE DATASET (IMD) BY THE CSES 
    SECRETARIAT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Besides combining and harmonizing individual studies from each module for 
IMD to ensure they are fit for comparative analysis, a key role of the CSES 
Secretariat is to perform several checks on the CSES IMD before it is 
released. These checks include (but are not confined to): 

   - CHECK OF DUPLICATE IDs
     Identification of respondents with corresponding answers to all 
     questions or respondent identification data that are similar 

   - PARTY/COALITION HARMONIZATION CHECKS
     To ensure the accuracy of the harmonization of party/coalition codes 
     developed specifically for CSES IMD (see variables IMD3002, IMD3004, 
     and IMD3005_3). 

   - IRREGULAR AND EXTRAORDINARY CODE CHECKS 
     Identification of irregular and extraordinary codes in the CSES IMD 
     Dataset. Sometimes these irregular or extraordinary codes are 
     legitimate in the sense that they may be accounted for by a polity
     deviation on a particular variable. Other times, these data may have 
     been miscoded in the Standalone CSES Modules. In circumstances where
     the CSES Secretariat could verify the miscode and a potential 
     correction, these irregular and extraordinary codes were altered. 
     Where this was impossible, the codes were left as is but documented in
     CSES IMD. 

   - THEORETICAL CHECKS  
     These series of checks explore expected relationships between 
     variables that we might expect to occur (e.g., correlation between
     Political Efficacy and Satisfaction with Democracy). We do this by 
     exploring distributions, correlation analysis, and regression analysis
     across CSES IMD but also extending the checks to the Standalone CSES 
     Modules. 

   - DATA OVERVIEW CHECKS
     These series of checks if the data particulars (such as total number  
     of observations, number of observations per polity, and the data 
     collection period are consistent with documentation. 

   - MACRO DATA CONSISTENCY CHECKS
     These series of checks explore the internal consistency of macro data 
     over-time.

   - VARIABLE AND VALUE LABEL CHECKS
     To ensure all variables in CSES IMD are appropriately assigned labels 
     and documented in the CSES IMD Codebook.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> HOW TO MERGE STANDALONE CSES MODULE DATA NOT INCLUDED IN CSES IMD 
    TO THE CSES IMD FILE?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several ways to merge administrative, demographic, or survey 
level data from the Standalone CSES Modules (and which have not been 
included in CSES IMD due to ineligibility or phased development of the
product) to the CSES IMD dataset. One option is to use Variable IMD1005 
(ID Variable  Respondent), which uniquely identifies each respondent 
within the IMD dataset and which also identifies a respondent within the 
Standalone CSES Module. 

Regarding merging macro data from the Standalone CSES Modules (and which 
have not been included in CSES IMD due to ineligibility or phased 
development of the product) to the CSES IMD dataset, several polity and 
election study level identifiers within CSES IMD allow for amalgamation. 
They include: 
  -	IMD1003 which is an Election Study Identifier detailing the 
        Numerical Polity Code and Election Year.
  -	IMD1004 which is an Election Study Identifier detailing the
        Alphabetical Polity Code and Election Year.
  -	IMD 1006_UN which is a Polity Identifier detailing the UN Numerical 
        Polity Code assigned to each polity. 
  -	IMD1006_NAM which is a Polity Identifier detailing the Alphabetical 
        verbatim name of each polity 

Regarding merging of relational data for parties/leaders assigned 
alphabetical codes, as parties/leaders in CSES IMD retain the alphabetical
coding assigned to parties/leaders in Standalone CSES Modules, these data 
can be merged using the alphabetical codes along with the appropriate 
election study, polity, or Standalone CSES Module specification.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> HOW TO SELECT DATA FROM ONE OR MULTIPLE STANDALONE CSES MODULES OR 
    ELECTIONS HELD IN A PARTICULAR YEAR IN CSES IMD?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CSES IMD contains two variables that allow selection of data from 
particular Standalone CSES Modules or elections held in a particular year. 

IMD1008_Year allows users to select particular election years for analysis. 

IMD1008_MOD_1,  IMD1008_MOD_2,  IMD1008_MOD_3,  IMD1008_MOD_4 allows users 
to select particular Standalone CSES Modules.
