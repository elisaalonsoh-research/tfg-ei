))) IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING ADVANCE RELEASE
===========================================================================

This dataset and all accompanying documentation is the "Fourth Advance 
Release" of CSES Module 5 (2016-2021).

By definition, an Advance Release is a preliminary version of a dataset,
and thus lacks some of the checking, cleaning, processing, documentation,
data, and variables that are usual to the Full Release of a dataset. Many
election studies that will eventually be present in the CSES Module 5 Full
Release are not available in this file.

Advance Releases are provided as a service to the CSES user community,
for those analysts who find it valuable to work with preliminary versions
of the dataset. We would appreciate being notified of any errors in the
dataset or documentation by email to "cses@umich.edu".

Users should expect future changes and improvements to the naming, data,
and documentation of variables and election studies that appear in an
Advance Release file. If users wish to re-use their programming code on
a future release of the file, the code should be written in a way that is
flexible and can be accommodating of these future changes.

Users of the Advance Release may also wish to monitor the errata for
CSES Module 5 on the CSES website, to check for known errors which
may impact their analyses. To view errata for CSES Module 5, go to Data
Download on the CSES website, navigate to the CSES Module 5 download page,
and click on the Errata link in the white box to the right of the page.

We hope that until such time as the Full Release of CSES Module 5 is
available, users will find this and future CSES Module 5 Advance Releases
to be helpful in their work.

))) OVERVIEW OF "CODEBOOK PART 6: STUDY DESIGNS AND WEIGHTS"
===========================================================================

Part 6 of the CSES Codebook provides users with general information about
the design of each election study included in Module 5, as well as the 
original polity level weights for each study. 
 
The purpose of these overviews is to provide users with a quick summary 
of the study and the weights, including information about the sample size, 
the fieldwork period, sample selection procedures, the mode(s) of interview,
and the language(s) the survey was administered in. 
 
For more detailed information about each study's design and its weights,
including information on response rates, refusal conversion, questionnaire
translation, respondent incentives etc., users are advised to consult 
the Design Reports for each polity included in the study which are available
on the CSES Module 5 Study Page:  
(see https://cses.org/data-download/cses-module-5-2016-2021/). 


===========================================================================
))) HOW TO NAVIGATE THE CSES MODULE 5 CODEBOOK

>>> POLITY WEIGHTS IN CSES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSES provides users with up to three original weights from each 
national election study (see variable E1010_) namely:

  - SAMPLE WEIGHT (variable E1010_1): 
    intended to correct for unequal selection probabilities resulting from 
    booster samples procedures for selection within the household, 
    non-response, or other sample design features 

  - DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT (variable E1010_2): 
    intended to adjust sample distributions of socio-demographic 
    characteristics to more closely resemble the characteristics of the 
    population

  - POLITICAL WEIGHT (variable E1010_3): 
    intended to reconcile discrepancies in the reported electoral behavior
    of respondents vis-a-vis official electoral counts. 

Users are advised to read carefully about the different weights in CSES to 
ascertain whether their analyses should be subjected to weighting and if so 
which kind. The CSES project does not provide advice as to which weights 
are appropriate to use in particular circumstances. This is best left to 
analysts to decide based on their detailed knowledge of the research 
question under investigation. We advise analysts to consult each Polity's
Design Report on the CSES Module 5 Study Page (see
https://cses.org/data-download/cses-module-5-2016-2021/). 
For information on derivative weights calculated for the Cross-National 
Dataset, users should consult Parts 1 and 2 (variables E1011-E1014) 
of the CSES Codebook.

>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - AUSTRALIA (2019)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2019 Federal election in Australia took place on Saturday, May 18, 2019.
Fieldwork for the Australian study began on June 3, 2019, 16 days after the
election day. Data collection was completed after 14 days, ending on June
17, 2019. The study, undertaken by Australian National University (ANU) in
Canberra, was conducted as part of wave 28 of Social Research Center's Life
in Australia panel. Members of the panel are Australian residents aged 18
years or more. A total of 2,676 active panel members were invited to take
part in the survey, and 2,000 completed the survey. The survey was
administered in the English language. The study used a mixed-mode approach,
including both online and telephone surveys.

A dual-frame random digit dialing (RDD) sample design was employed to
undertake recruitment of the Life in Australia panel in 2016, with a 30:70
split between the landline RDD sample frame and a mobile phone RDD sample
frame. For the landline sample, an alternating next/last birthday method
was used to randomly select respondents from households where two or more
in-scope persons were present. For the mobile sample, the individual who
answered the call was the selected respondent. Only one member per household 
was invited to join the panel. In May 2018, the panel was refreshed with 
267 new panelists. For both the recruitment in 2016 and panel refreshment 
in 2018, the RDD sample was provided by SamplePages. Panelists receive a 
small incentive to join the panel and another incentive for each survey they
complete. For the Australian (2019) study, all respondents were offered a
10 Australian dollars (AUD) incentive and they had a choice to either
collect the money or to transfer it as a charitable donation to a
designated charity.


<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS

The Australian Election Study provides a SAMPLE WEIGHT. This weight adjusts
for the unequal probability of selection. Since some units in the
population may not have a chance of selection (for instance, persons
without a telephone have no chance of selection for a telephone survey) and
there may be different rates of response across unit characteristics,
sample weights reduce the extent of any biases introduced through
non-coverage. Weights are constructed in the following two steps:
1. Compute a base weight for each respondent as the product of two weights:
a. their enrollment weight, accounting for the initial chances of selection
and subsequent post-stratification to key demographic benchmarks;
b. their response propensity weight, estimated from enrollment information
available for both respondents and non-respondents to the present wave.
2. Calibrate the base weights so that they satisfy the latest population
benchmarks for several demographic characteristics.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - AUSTRIA (2017)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN     

The election was held on October 15, 2017, and fieldwork for the study 
began four days later, on October 19, 2017. The fieldwork period lasted 
for 42 days and ended on November 30, 2017. All interviews were conducted 
by IPR Umfrageforschung via telephone (mobile and landline). The language 
of survey administration was German. In total, 1,203 interviews were 
completed, and the sample is meant to be representative of all eligible
voters in Austria at the day of the election (Austrian citizens, age 16
or older). The primary sampling units were Austrian municipalities, all of 
which were included in the first stage of the sampling procedure. The 
sampling procedure included two further stages, namely, at the household 
and respondent level. Households within the municipalities were randomly 
selected (proportional to the size of the municipality), using a dual-frame
(50% list frame and 50% random digit dial). Within households, the 
target person was randomly selected using the next-birthday method. 


<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS

The dataset includes two weights for Austria 2017, a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT and
a POLITICAL WEIGHT. The demographic weight (E1010_2) adjusts the sample to 
match known demographic characteristics in the voting age population (age, 
gender, education, region, household size, and employment type). The 
political weight (E1010_3) is a combined weight that adjusts the sample to 
match the national election results on top of the demographic weight. The 
combined weight E1010_3 is a winsorized weight in which upper and lower 
boundaries were determined by the field institute.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - BELGIUM - FLANDERS (2019)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2019 Belgium Federal elections were held on Sunday, May 26, 2019. The 
study had two dimensions: a component designed to capture a representative 
sample of French speakers and a component designed to capture a 
representative sample of Dutch speakers. These two components mapped on to
Belgium's two principal regions - Wallonia, composed principally of French 
primary speakers, and Flanders, composed principally of primary Dutch 
speakers. Consequently, separate samples were drawn for both 
Belgium-Wallonia and Belgium-Flanders, which also captures the fact that
both regions have substantially different political configurations, with
different political actors contesting each region, and most parties 
contesting one of the regions only. The Belgium-Flanders sample is 
representative of the eligible voting population residing in 
Belgium-Flanders only (i.e., electoral regions of Antwerp, East Flanders, 
Flemish Brabant, Limburg, and West Flanders). 

Fieldwork for the Belgium-Flanders component of the Belgian study began 
three days after the election, on May 29, 2019. Data collection ended after 
119 days, on September 24, 2019, with 1,084 respondents completing the 
survey. Questionnaires were sent to respondents with the option to 
complete them on paper and send them back (mail-back) or to complete the 
questionnaire online. Respondents in Belgium-Flanders received the Dutch 
questionnaire. KU Leuven, Center for Political Research, conducted the
fieldwork.

All respondents had to be Belgium citizens with registered residence in
Flanders and eligible to vote in the Belgian federal elections. Belgium
citizens living in foreign countries have the right to vote but
were not sampled for the election study. Also, voters above 85 years old
were not approached to participate. This group comprises between 2 and 3 
percent of the population in Flanders.
A random selection of 4,000 voters in Flanders was selected by the Belgian
National Register and drawn from their National Register of all voters in
Flanders. The Belgian National Register made the random selection due
to strict privacy regulations. The entire sample of 4,000 voters was used in
the initial approach, and all drawn voters were invited to fill out the
questionnaire.


<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS

The Belgium-Flanders Election Study provides a DEMOGRAPHIC and a POLITICAL
WEIGHT. The weights were created using the IPF-procedure in Stata.
The demographic weight (E1010_2) was constructed based on the most recent
available data for age, gender, and education level.
The political weight (E1010_3) includes the same variables as for the
demographic weight, and the vote choice as reported by the respondents
compared to the official election results. Where necessary, Belgium
collaborators calculated distributions themselves to make sure all
information was correct for the specific geographical region. Available 
information was subdivided by age so that the distributions are corrected
for the population older than 18 (which should give a better estimate for
educational level, for instance).

both regions have substantially different political configurations, with
different political actors contesting each region, and most parties 
contesting one of the regions only. The Belgium-Wallonia sample is 
representative of the eligible voting population residing in 
Belgium-Wallonia only (i.e., electoral regions of Brabant, Hainaut, Liege, 
Luxembourg, and Namur). The Belgium-Capital Region (Brussels), which is 
principally French-speaking is deliberately not sampled because of 
logistical challenges in the implementation of the study - principally its 
geographic location within the Flanders region, and the challenges of 
distributing the appropriate language mail-back questionnaire to respondents
as a result.  

Fieldwork for the Belgium-Wallonia component of the Belgian study began 
three days after the election, on May 29, 2019. Data collection ended after 
119 days, on September 24, 2019, with 730 respondents completing the 
survey. Questionnaires were sent to respondents with the option to complete

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The Brazilian Election Study was conducted between November 10 to November
14, 2018. Fieldwork lasted 14 days and started 35 days after the first
round and 14 days after the second round of elections. IBOPE Inteligencia
of Sao Paolo collected data in face-to-face interviews using an electronic
questionnaire (CAPI). Interviewing was conducted in the Portuguese language
with all Brazilian citizens, 16 years old and older, and registered to vote
eligible to be interviewed. 

The sample for the Brazilian study is stratified per state. In the case of
states with metropolitan areas, its universe is stratified in metropolitan
areas and countryside. The cities are selected in each stratum, using a
probabilistic approach, specifically through a PPS (Probability 
Proportional to Size) method. By this method, 172 cities were selected. 
In the second stage, census tracts are selected with systematic PPS. In the 
third stage, a fixed number of respondents are selected according to 
quotas based on gender, age, education, line of work, and the number of 
bathrooms in the household. These quotas were set considering the census 
update survey from IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) 
2010, PNADC 2016 (National Survey by Household Sample) and TSE 2018 
(Superior Electoral Court). After census tracts were chosen by random walk, 
in total 2,506 interviews were collected.

>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - CANADA (2019)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The Canadian Election Study is composed of a post-election survey fielded 
between October 22, 2019, and November 21, 2019, although some questions
(e.g., some demographic questions) were fielded in the pre-election survey
of respondents.  The data was collected by the organization Advantis Inc. 
The data collection was funded by the Social Science and Research Council 
of Canada and archived by the Canadian Opinion Research Archive.

The fieldwork for the survey was conducted by phone and via the internet.
In the pre-election survey, all participants were interviewed by phone. For 
the post-election survey, they had the option to complete it by phone again 
or online. In the first phase of data collection, the pre-election wave, 
4,021 telephone interviews were completed between September 10, 2019, and 
October 20, 2019. All those 4,021 respondents were called or emailed after 
the election and asked to complete the post-election survey. 2,889 (72%) 
respondents completed it, of which 2,067 (72%) did it over the phone and 822
(28%) online. Therefore, the attrition rate was 28%.

Interviews were conducted in English and in French, and the sample is 
designed to be representative of the Canadian population aged 18 years and 
older in the ten Canadian provinces, with the territories excluded. 
The territories (Northwest Territories, Yukon Territory, Nunavut) were 
excluded from the sampling frame, as is the practice with Canadian Election
Studies. The population of those areas is approximately 0.3%. 
Non-residential respondents were excluded as well (0.2%). As the interviews
were conducted by telephone, another 0.7% of the population without a phone
could not be reached. All in all, this leads to 1.2% of the population that
was excluded from the sample frame. 

Respondents were selected by modified random digit dialing and a birthday 
selection method within households. If there was more than one eligible 
person in the household at a landline phone number, the person with the next
birthday was requested as the survey respondent. The birthday selection 
method was used as it ensures a random selection of respondents and is a 
much less intrusive way to start an interview than asking about the number 
of people in the household, thus making it easier for the interviewer to 
secure the respondent's cooperation. The sample was stratified by province, 
targeting 20% of the sample from each of Ontario, Quebec, the Prairies 
(Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta), the Atlantic provinces (divided evenly
among Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland) and
British Columbia.

To ensure a high response rate and an excellent interview quality, the 
interviewers are trained to use various interviewing techniques. Apart from 
maintaining a professional attitude, the interviewers must also be 
convincing, read word for word, take notes, probe deeper on semi-open and 
open questions, systematically confirm the information given, and listen to 
the respondent. 


<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS 

The 2019 Canadian Election Study contains a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT for the 
post-election survey. The collaborators decided that the weight is required 
due to the stratification and the dual-frame (cell/ landline phone) design. 

In order to produce national estimates, it was necessary to correct for both
the province of residence and the phone ownership type as these are both 
factors that influenced the sample design for the Canadian Election Study. 
In order to determine the phone ownership type and hence the probability of
inclusion of a particular respondent in the study, each respondent was 
asked at the end of the pre-election survey if they have a wireless phone 
(if they completed on landline) or a landline phone (if they completed on 
wireless). Respondents were then assigned an ownership type of landline 
only, wireless only, both, or refused/don't know. Population proportions 
among the ten provinces were taken from the 2016 Census and 2017 data for 
phone ownership by province was used to create a joint probability for 
phone ownership among each of the provinces. Respondents who refused to 
provide details about their phone ownership were given a phone ownership 
type population proportion equal to their sample proportion within 
province, so as not to artificially create population proportions for this 
subset. Weights are calculated by dividing the population proportion by the
sample proportion for each subgroup so that each is "adjusted up" or 
"adjusted down" in the overall picture to provide a sample distribution 
representative of the joint population proportion on the province and phone
ownership metrics.

>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - CHILE (2017)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The General elections in Chile were held on November 19, 2017. These
elections included parliamentary elections (both Lower and Upper house) and
the presidential elections. The second round of presidential elections was
held on December 17, 2017. The fieldwork for the Chilean study started one 
day after the second round of Presidential elections, on December 18, 2017, 
and lasted until January 31, 2018. The Feedback organization from Santiago, 
Chile conducted interviews. The survey was fielded in Spanish, with 
face-to-face interviewing using a questionnaire on paper. The Chilean 2017
study is meant to be representative of all citizens of Chile aged 18 years 
living in Chile, including immigrants with at least five years of 
residence, which is a requirement to get the right to vote in Chile.

The sample for the study was created in four stages. At the first stage,
primary sampling units - "communas", were selected. These are the smallest
administrative units in Chile. They were ordered by size, and every comuna
with 50,000 inhabitants or more was automatically selected. Additionally,
a sample of 22 comunas (with less than 50,000 inhabitants) was randomly
selected. In the second stage, blocks inside the communas were selected 
using stratified random sampling, with a probability of selection 
proportional to the size of the blocks. In the third stage, households 
within blocks were selected using random systematic sampling procedures. 
Finally, respondents within households were selected using a Kish table. 
In total, 2,000 interviews were completed.

>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - COSTA RICA (2018)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The study is a post-election survey that was fielded between February 27,
2019, and March 6, 2019. The Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) 
funded the data collection. The collection was conducted by the Political
Studies and Research Center (CIEP), University of Costa Rica, starting
one year after the election.

Interviews were conducted in Spanish via the telephone. As the interviews
were conducted via the phone, Costa Ricans without access to a cell 
phone were excluded from the sampling frame (2.5% of the eligible 
population). The only excluded group are people who live abroad, but there 
are not official estimates of how many individuals this affects.

The sample frame consists of the available numbers assigned by operator. 
Superintendence of Telecommunications (SUTEL) publishes these numbers. 
SUTEL provides blocks of numbers that the study used for the selection of 
the sampling units. Those numbers were randomly selected, stratified by 
operator according to their market share. 15,000 telephone numbers were 
selected, from which a real sample of 1,456 was obtained. The number of 
non-active numbers in the sample frame was approximately 70% (10,430 invalid
(non-sample) households). Individuals were designated non-sample if there 
was no answer after three callbacks. 
The interviewers were undergraduate students of the University of Costa 
Rica. Interviewers received a six-hour training where they learned the rules 
of the process and the steps to conduct each interview. Interview 
verification was used where the supervisor called back a random number to
verify some information. About 5% of the completed surveys were verified. 
 
The sample consists of 1,456 completed interviews. As the study sampled
individuals and not households, more than one person could have been
interviewed from a single household.

<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS 

The 2018 Costa Rican Election Study contains a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT. The 
weight was constructed after collaborators compared expected values of 
demographic characteristics (gender, age and education) of the general 
population to the sample population. The expected values of those 
characteristics of the population were obtained from the National Household
Survey. Collaborators found that over- and under-representation in the 
survey were related to the educational level. Respondents with higher 
education, namely university degrees, were over-represented compared to 
those with lower education, namely primary education. 

The weight adjusts for educational differences. The weight was constructed
by dividing the value obtained in the sample by the expected value of the 
population. For those respondents for whom no information on their 
education is available, the demographic weight is coded 1.

The 2019 Danish post-election study was conducted online between June 6 and 
September 28, 2019, by Epinion A/S. Fieldwork started the day after the 
Danish general election on June 5, 2019. The questionnaire was administered
in Danish.
The sample is meant to represent eligible voters in Denmark, that is, Danish
citizens aged 18 and older who are registered to vote automatically if they 
permanently live in Denmark.

The study is based on a simple random sample drawn from the Danish person 
register ("CPR-register") wherein all Danish citizens and long-term 
inhabitants of Denmark must be registered. Hence, individuals were the 
primary sampling unit and had the same probability of being selected. 
Respondents were initially contacted via both postal and "digital mail". 
With few exceptions, digital mail is mandatory for Danish citizens. 
The survey was personally sent to respondents by the Danish digital post, 
verified by a personal access coding system. To increase response rates, 
collaborators conducted a lottery among all survey participants. Respondents
could win gift cards with a total value of 75,000 DKK. The resulting dataset
includes 1,418 completed interviews.

The political weight was created using raking and builds upon the 
demographic weight, additionally adjusting the sample according to vote 
choice in the 2019 Danish general election.

>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - FINLAND (2019)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2019 Finnish Parliamentary elections were held on Sunday, April 14,
2019. Fieldwork for the Finnish election study began three days after the
election, on April 17, 2019. After 172 days, on October 5, 2019, data
collection was completed, with 1,598 respondents completing the survey.
Taloustutkimus Oy market research company from Finland conducted the
fieldwork. Data were collected in person, face-to-face interviewing, using
an electronic/computerized questionnaire (CAPI). The survey was
administered in Finnish and Swedish language. Respondents were citizens
living in Finland who had the right to vote in the Finnish 2019
parliamentary elections (18 years old and older). Citizens from Aland
Islands were excluded from the sample (approximately 0.65% of the
population in Finland).

The sampling method was random route sampling within primary sampling units
used as starting points. ZIP codes were used as primary sampling units (PSU)
and these were randomly selected within each stratum. The sample was
stratified according to Eurostat NUTS-3 regions and degrees of urbanization
(DEGURBA) and allocated to quotas based on gender, age, area, and degree of
urbanization. The number of interviews was distributed to each stratum in
proportion to the 18+ population in each stratum. Overall, 12,442
households were in the sample. Households were selected so that the
interviewer was assigned a random starting address within the PSU. Then
interviewers selected households randomly. The interviewer screened
household members at the beginning of the interview. If the selected
respondent fitted the quotas, he/she was eligible for an interview. If an
individual refused to participate in the interview, another respondent was 
recruited using random route sampling.

The data collection organization programmed the questionnaire incorrectly
and consequently, 288 respondents were not asked several items in the
Finnish study. This affected two CSES items: turnout and vote choice
variables. The fault was detected after the data collection had concluded.
To amend the problem, the data collection organization attempted to
re-contact the affected respondents by phone to ask the questions that
had not been included during the initial interview. The affected
respondents did not retake the entire interview. For more information,
please consult ELECTION STUDY NOTES for Finland (2019) for variable E1007 
(Sampling Component), available in Part 2 of the CSES Module 5 Codebook.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

Interviewing for the French election study began on May 9, 2017, two days
after the second round of the 2017 Presidential Election, and continued 
until May 23, 2017. Kantar Public conducted fieldwork. Interviews were held
face-to-face and in French.

The sample is meant to be representative of the voting-eligible population,
i.e., French citizens who were 18 years or older at the time of the election
and registered to vote. Institutionalized persons were excluded from the 
sample, as were citizens living in the overseas territories due to 
cost considerations.

The sample was realized as a two-stage stratified quota sample. 
Stratification was based on a matrix cross-tabulating eight regions and four
different types of agglomeration (with Paris and its suburbs forming one of
these four categories). From the resulting matrix with 29 valid cells, 100
primary sampling units were randomly selected at the electoral district 
level (circonscriptions).
Within the selected circonscriptions, interviewers were instructed to follow
random routes starting from a random departure point within the district, 
including instructions on how to navigate through roads, intersections, 
city blocks, buildings, and mailboxes.

In the second stage, respondents were selected to match predefined quotas 
for gender (two categories), age (five categories), level of education (four
categories), and a combination of occupation (retired or not) and profession
(six categories). Quotas were designed to match the latest available data 
from official statistical sources, with one exception: For education, 
quotas deliberately underrepresent the lowest education level, reflecting 
differences in voter registration patterns based on education.
For each of the 100 primary sampling units, collaborators aimed for 18 
interviews, resulting in 1,830 completed interviews within the deposited 
sample.

>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - GERMANY (2017)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The CSES module is part of the German post-election cross-sectional study, 
for which the fieldwork was conducted between September 25 and November 30, 
2017, by Infratest dimap Gesellschaft fuer Trend- und Wahlforschung GmbH. 
Data collection started one day after the federal election on September 24 
and lasted for 67 days. The questionnaire was administered in German and 
in-person (CAPI).

The sample is designed to be representative of all German citizens with 
registered residence in the Federal Republic of Germany aged 16 and older, 
who were (in principle - if underage) eligible to vote in the German 
federal elections on September 24, 2017. The sample provided to CSES only 
includes 18-year-olds and above. Residents of islands without land 
connection and institutionalized persons were excluded from the sampling 
frame (together, less than 0.3% of the eligible population). 

The survey employed a two-stage stratified random sampling procedure based 
on resident registers. The primary sampling units were 162 randomly 
selected sampling points (108 in Western Germany, 54 in Eastern Germany). 
The sampling points corresponded to a set number of addresses to be 
selected in the respective municipality during the second stage. Sampling 
points were allocated to municipalities following a Cox algorithm. Because 
of the designed oversampling of Eastern Germans, this procedure was 
conducted separately for Eastern and Western Germany. The allocation 
procedure of sampling points to municipalities accounted for stratification 
along regional criteria. Larger municipalities could be allocated multiple 
sampling points. After the allocation, a total of 162 sampling points were 
selected by a systematic drawing procedure with random starts for each 
regional stratum. In case multiple sampling points were drawn in a 
municipality, the number of addresses selected was increased accordingly. 
In a second stage, individual respondents were selected from the sampled 
municipalities. The raw sample of respondents was drawn randomly from the 
pre-selected municipalities. The selection made use of the state resident 
register. Again, the procedure used stratification with an age-group x 
gender-structure matrix. Large municipalities (100,000 inhabitants and 
above) selected in the first stage were divided into up to 12 spatial 
clusters. Out of those, four were randomly selected to be included in the 
individual sampling procedure of the second stage.

region (East / West Germany). Weights were calculated with an iterative 
proportional fitting procedure.

>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - GREAT BRITAIN (2017)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The study is a post-election survey that was fielded between June 26,
2017, and October 02, 2017, 18 days after the general election. The data
was collected by a consortium of three fieldwork agencies: Gfk, Kantar 
Public, and NatCen. The fieldwork was coordinated by Gfk. The data 
collection was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and is 
archived by the UK Data Service.

The main fieldwork for the survey was conducted in person using CAPI. Some 
CSES questions were included in the self-completion mail-back survey.
Respondents had the option of completing this section of the survey either 
via the internet or a mail-back paper questionnaire. 
Interviews were conducted in English, and the sample is representative of 
the population of 18 years and older inhabitants living in Great Britain 
who were eligible to vote in the 2017 election. For practical reasons, the 
sample frame did not include the northern islands, excluding less than 
0.25% of the eligible population. The study was not part of a panel study.
984 participants completed the interviews. 

The sample is drawn from the small user Postcode Address file. Some 
sections of the population fall outside this sampling frame, e.g., elderly 
people in residential care, prisoners and military personnel living in 
defense establishments, excluding about 2% of the eligible population. The
sample was selected based on a multi-stage design based on (1) a stratified 
random sample of 234 Parliamentary constituencies, (2) two Lower Layer 
Super Output Areas (LSOAs) per constituency which were selected with  
probability proportional to size, (3) selection of addresses from the Small  
User Postcode Address File (PAF), and (4) one individual randomly selected  
per address by the interviewer. 
The primary sampling units are parliamentary constituencies. 234 from 630
constituencies were sampled from the whole of Great Britain. At the 
first stage, the constituencies were stratified by country and then 
(within England) by Region. Within each country/region, constituencies were
classified by party competition, defined as a combination of winning party 
and party competition from the 2010 election. The final stage of 
stratification was to sort the constituencies within each cell from the 
least to the most marginal. The constituencies were then selected with 
probability proportional to population size.
At each address, the interviewer established the number of dwellings, then 
households, and finally people aged 18 or over who were eligible to vote in 
the general election. At each of these levels, if there was more than one 
unit present, one was selected by the interviewer using a Kish grid, 
randomized for each address. Respondents received a gift voucher between 
10 GBP and 25 GBP for their participation.


<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS 

To ensure that the respondents who took part in the study represent the 
views of the population, the data were weighted. Two weights were applied: 
Initially, selection weights to correct for unequal selection probabilities 
and secondly, post-stratification weights which account for differing levels 
of response from various groups in the population.

The 2017 British Election Study contains a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT. The weight
was constructed after collaborators found that several demographics need to 
be considered for the non-response weighting. They decided that the 
demographics that should be corrected were age, gender, and region. The 
targets for these were taken from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) 
mid-year population estimates and weights were calculated after the 
selection weights had been applied.

The Parliamentary elections in Greece were held on September 20, 2015. 
These were the second Parliamentary elections in 2015, nine months after
the January elections. The fieldwork for the Greece study started 39 days 
after the election, on October 29, 2015. After 124 days, data collection
phase, conducted by the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, School of 
Political Sciences, was completed. The survey was fielded in Greek and
is meant to be representative of all Greek citizens with voting rights (18
years of age and older). Two interview modes were used: telephone and
internet. Respondents were recruited via phone and offered to fill out the
questionnaire either online (CAWI) or via telephone (CATI). Because of this
recruitment procedure, approximately 18% of households in Greece were
excluded because they do not have a phone.

The geographical area was sampled at the first stage, the area code was
identified, and the telephone numbers were selected during the second stage
by random sampling. Random Digital Dialing (RDD) method was used to select
respondents for the study. The individual who answered the phone call was
asked to participate in the survey after verifying that they were eligible 
to vote. If the respondent had an e-mail address, he/she would be
encouraged to fill out the questionnaire online. If the respondent had no
e-mail address or Internet access, they would be offered a telephone
interview. More than 800 respondents from the study conducted after the
January 2015 elections said they are willing to participate again. They
were also contacted, either via e-mail or via phone. Up to four follow-up
reminders were sent through email to all the respondents in order to
increase the response rate of the survey. In total, 1,078 interviews were 
completed.


<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS

The 2015 Greek Election Study includes a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT. The Weight was
constructed using the method of raking on gender, age and education. With
post-stratification the population was partitioned into subgroups, then the
original weights (in Greek case all equal to one) were multiplied by a 
ratio which was formed by the corresponding population post-stratum size 
in the nominator and the corresponding sample post-stratum size in the 
denominator. Raking allows multiple grouping variables to be used by 
post-stratifying on each variable in turn, and the process was repeated 
until the weights stopped changing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2016 Hong Kong election study was conceptualized as a cross-sectional 
post-election telephone survey (CATI) and conducted between September 6 and
September 18, 2016. Fieldwork realized by the Public Governance Programme 
started two days after the Legislative Council election on September 4. 
The questionnaire was administered in Chinese (Cantonese and Putonghua). 
The sample is meant to be representative of registered voters, that is, 
permanent residents of Hong Kong who are aged 18 or above. 
Institutionalized persons were excluded from the sample (at most 0.3% 
of the total eligible population). The same is true for military personnel 
who do not have permanent residency in Hong Kong and therefore are not 
eligible to vote. As fixed-line telephone numbers were called for 
interviews, other possible exclusions resulted from an unknown percentage 
of residents without a fixed-line phone connection. The residential 
fixed-line penetration rate (RFLPR) was used as a proxy measurement and 
suggests that for every 100 households, there were 94.5 fixed telephone 
lines in 2016 in Hong Kong. However, as some households have more than one 
fixed line, the number of households without a fixed line is unknown. 
The total percentage of excluded persons from the sample was estimated to 
accumulate to 5.8 percent.  

The study was realized as a two-stage random sample. In the first stage, 
phone numbers were selected randomly from the pool of numbers maintained by 
collaborators. The last two digits were exchanged with random numbers to 
account for numbers not listed in the sampling frame. 
In the second stage, individual respondents were randomly selected from the 
households called. The person answering the phone call was asked how many 
registered voters lived within the household. That number was entered into 
the CATI system, which would randomly draw one of the eligible persons to 
be the interviewee. In total, the dataset contains 1,020 completed 
interviews.


<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS

The Hong Kong Election Study includes a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT. It was 
constructed to correct for known divergences of the sample in comparison to 
the population of registered voters. The weights take the distributions 
of age and sex into account, as indicated by official statistics. For
each particular age-sex category, the weight was obtained by dividing 
the share of persons in the population for that category by the share of
respondents in the sample for that category.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The parliamentary elections in Hungary were held on April 8, 2018. The
interviewing for the Hungarian study started 15 days after the election, on
April 23. Median Opinion and Market Research Institute from Budapest,
Hungary conducted the fieldwork. The survey was fielded in Hungarian, using
face-to-face interviewing and an electronic questionnaire. All individuals
residing in Hungary who are 18 years and older and have the right to vote 
were eligible respondents for the study. Institutionalized persons were 
excluded from the sample.

The sample for the study was created using the multi-stage randomized
procedure. At the first stage, 120 sampling units representative of the
local population were selected based on the census data of the Hungarian
Central Statistical Office (KSH). Then 20 addresses from each sampling unit
were drawn. In the final stage, at each address, interviewers only
interviewed one member of the household determined using the Leslie Kish
key. In total, 1,097 interviews were conducted, of which 120 were excluded
as invalid after having listened to the audio recordings. The sample size
achieved through the determined sampling process is 957 respondents. The
composition of the sample was heavily distorted regarding gender and age.
The distortion of the sample was compensated in an additional round of
data collection by determining quotas based on the missing elements from
the desired sample in terms of gender and age. The final dataset consists
of 1,208 respondents.

The election was held on October 29, 2016, and fieldwork for the study 
began one day later, on October 30, 2016. The fieldwork period lasted for 
87 days and was completed on January 25, 2017. All interviews were 
conducted by the Social Science Research Institute of the University of 
Iceland via telephone (landline and mobile phones). The language of survey 
administration was Icelandic. In total, 1,295 interviews were completed, and
the dataset is meant to be representative of the eligible voting population
in Iceland (age 18 or older). The primary sampling unit was individual 
voters on the Iceland National Register. Individuals were selected from the 
register using a simple random sample. This method yielded 2,600 potential

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2016 Irish general election took place on Friday, February 26, 2016. 
Fieldwork began six days after the elections were held. All interviews were 
carried out by RED C Research & Marketing Ltd between March 1 and March 6, 
2016. The survey was administered in English via telephone. To be eligible 
for inclusion, respondents had to be Irish citizens and be at least 18 
years old. Institutionalized persons were excluded from the sample. The 
sample was drawn in two stages. In the first stage of the sampling 
procedure, the field institute used the random digit dial (RDD) method to 
randomly select households. These respondents were interviewed in twelve 
pre-election polls leading up to the election. Half of the sample was 
interviewed using an RDD landline, the other half using an RDD mobile phone 
line. Approximately 65% of the respondents interviewed in the pre-election 
polls agreed to be re-contacted for the post-election study in which the 
CSES questionnaire was administered. This led to a sample poll of 8,000 
respondents. A random contact approach was conducted among this set of
respondents, using both a landline approach and a mobile approach. The 
sample was stratified along quotas so that it would accurately represent 
the electorate. If necessary, to fulfill the quotas, new interviews from
the initial RDD were conducted. In total, 1,000 interviews were completed.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The post-election survey was fielded between June 7, 2020, and August 6, 
2020. The election took place just before the COVID-19 pandemic was declared 
a pandemic on March 11, 2020, although fieldwork for the 2020 study was 
conducted during the pandemic. Nonetheless, as the study was fielded via 
telephone, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic did not affect the study's data 
collection. 
The fieldwork period began 97 days after the legislative election and took 
51 days in total. The language of the survey administration was Hebrew and 
Arabic. The fieldwork was carried out by the B.I. and Lucille Cohen 
Institute for Public Opinion Research and funded by the Israeli Science 
Foundation. To be interviewed, a person needed to be an Israeli citizen 
above 18 years old. 

Institutionalized persons were excluded from the sample as sampling was 
done using the country's official household registrar, which only includes 
registered household phone numbers. As interviews were conducted by 
telephone, about 36% of the households were excluded because they did not 
have a phone. 

The primary sampling units (PSU) were individuals in households. These PSUs 
were selected using random sampling from the national household registrar. 
The sampling was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, a random 
sample of adult citizens was compiled based on the national household 
registrar. In the second stage, this sample was matched with phone numbers. 
Only one adult in each household was interviewed. Stratification was not 
included. In total, 1,209 interviews were completed.

influence over weighted estimates, the final weights were trimmed using an 
upper threshold of four.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The election was held on March 4, 2018, and fieldwork for the study began 
four days later, on March 8, 2018. The fieldwork period lasted for 55 days 
and ended on May 2, 2018. All surveys were administered by Demetra 
Opinioni.net via telephone, mobile phone, and the internet. The language of 
survey administration was Italian. In total, 2,001 surveys were completed, 
and the data is meant to be representative of the Italian voting age 
population according to the Lower House Electoral Rules (Italian residents, 
age 18 or older; the voting age for Upper House Elections, also included in 
the study, is 25 years). The initial sample was drawn in two steps. In a 
first step, the collaborators randomly drew electoral districts within 
seven macro areas, stratified by the population in of those macro areas and 
excluding nine large cities (Bari, Bologna, Florence, Genoa, Milan, Naples,
Palermo, Rome, and Turin). The region Valle d'Aosta/Vallee d'Aoste and the
province Bolzano/Bozen were excluded from the sample frame because voters
living in the region voted under different electoral rules than the rest
of Italy. This resulted in the exclusion of approximately 1.53% of the
eligible voting population. 
In the second step of the sampling procedure, the field institute sampled 
respondents for an online component of the study, a phone component, and a 
mobile phone component of the study in the following ways. For the online 
component, panelists of an existing Demetra Opinioni.net web panel (total 
N=13,734; initial recruitment by Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing, 
CATI) were randomly selected within the selected districts from the first 
sampling step as well as the nine larger cities. The chosen panelists were
invited to participate in the election study via email and provided with 
the opportunity to fill out the election study questionnaire online. 
Invited panelists were offered a telephone top-up or Amazon voucher worth 
1EUR upon completion. 59.63% of invited panelists completed the survey. 
For the second set of respondents (N=1,501), respondents were selected 
using a dual frame (66% list frame and 34% Random Digit Dialing) through 
random digit dialing based on the national phone book and random digit 
dialing for mobile phone interviews. Respondents selected from the 
national phone book were interviewed using Computer Assisted Telephone 
Interviewing (CATI; N of completed interviews=1,000) and respondents 
selected by random digit dialing for mobile interviews were interviewed 
using Computer Assisted Mobile Interviewing (CAMI; N of completed 
interviews=500). Respondents chosen for the mobile phone interviews were 
asked at the beginning of the interview about the city and neighborhood
they resided in. If they did not live in a city or district sampled in the
first stage, the interviews were canceled, and the respondents were flagged
as ineligible. In total, the two-stage sampling procedure resulted in 
approximately 20 interviews per electoral district (range: 14 to 26 
interviews) except for Milan (73 interviews), Naples (38 interviews), 
Rome (102 interviews) and Turin (47 interviews), where more respondents
were interviewed. 


<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS

The dataset includes three weights for ITALY 2018, a SAMPLE WEIGHT, a
DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT, and a POLITICAL WEIGHT, each of which was created for 
the whole dataset. The sample weight (E1010_1) adjusts the sample to
correct for the different selection probabilities of clusters (i.e. 
constituencies and large cities) within different macro-areas as well as 
for the different probabilities of selection of individuals within 
clusters. The demographic weight (E1010_2) adjusts the sample to match 
known demographic characteristics, namely gender (male, female), age group 
(18-44, 45-59, 60+), geographical area (north, center, south), and 
education (low, middle, high). The political weight (E1010_3) adjusts the 
sample to the population frequencies by vote shares of the major coalitions 
and parties (center-right and center-left) in the lower house election and  
abstainers at the regional level. 
Because the voting age differs between the lower house (18 years and older) 
and the upper house (25 years and older), users should be aware that 
applying any of the three weights when analyzing upper house elections may
result in non-representative results.

The 2017 Japanese general election was held on Sunday, October 22,
2017. Fieldwork for the Japanese election study began on January 12, 2018.
After 61 days, on March 13, 2018, data collection was completed, with 1,688
respondents completing the survey. The survey was administered by The 
Central Research Services, Inc. market research company. 

Data were primarily collected face-to-face, using a paper questionnaire. 
Respondents not reached in person were sent a copy of the questionnaire and
asked to return it via mail. Surveys were administered in Japanese. 
Respondents were adult citizens (18 years old and older) who held Japanese 
citizenship and were registered voters for the 2017 General election.

The sample for the Japanese study was drawn in a multi-stage procedure. In
the first step, cities, towns, and villages were categorized into five
categories:
- 21 big cities,
- cities with more than 200,000 populations,
- cities with more than 100,000 populations,
- other smaller cities, and
- towns and villages.

To each category, 3,000 cases with 220 sampling points were allocated. These
3,000 cases were randomly chosen from each municipality's voters' list.
Electoral districts (Japanese "chiten") were primary sampling points. 
These PSUs were stratified by region (eleven categories) and city (the five
categories mentioned above), which produced an 11 by 5 table (55 cells). The
number of chitens (220 in total) were assigned to each cell proportionally 
to the size of the population.

The sample weight was constructed using the categories gender by age by
location. The age variable was grouped into five categories, and the
location was grouped into six categories to avoid using 11 locations and
small weighting cells, given only 1,688 respondents in total. The

The first round of Parliamentary elections in Lithuania was held on
October 9, 2016. The second round of elections, in constituencies where no
candidate won the required majority to be elected, was held on October 23,
2016. The interviewing for the Lithuanian study started 33 days after the 
first round and 19 days after the second round of elections, on November 
11. Baltic Surveys Ltd from Vilnius, Lithuania, conducted the fieldwork. 
The survey was fielded in Lithuanian, using face-to-face interviews with a
paper questionnaire. The Lithuanian study is meant to be representative of
all citizens of Lithuania aged 18 years or older who are registered to 
vote, with only the homeless people being excluded from the sample frame.

The sample for the study was created using multi-stage stratified 
proportional sampling. At the first stage, based on the Nomenclature of
Territorial Units as used in the official EU statistics, the Republic of
Lithuania was divided into ten administrative units (counties). Then, the
total number of interviews in each survey region (county) was allocated to
six strata in proportion to the population of each stratum. The stratum is
defined by settlement size. In the third stage, primary sampling units 
were randomly selected from each stratum (county and settlement size 
combination cell) list. After that, households were selected using the
random route from the starting point, and respondents within households 
were selected by using the "last birthday rule" among all household members 
aged 18 years and older. In total, 1,500 interviews were completed.

The 2016 Montenegrin cross-sectional post-election study was conducted as a 
face-to-face survey, from December 8, 2016, to January 16, 2017. Data 
collection was realized by the De Facto Consultancy, starting 53 days after
the parliamentary election on October 16, 2016. Interviews were conducted 
in Montenegrin. The sample is meant to be representative of eligible 
Montenegrin citizens aged 18 years or older and registered to vote. 
Institutionalized persons (people in prison or hospitals) were excluded 
from the sample (less than 1 percent of the eligible population).

The sampling was conceptualized as a stratified multistage random sample, 
with three stages in total. In the first stage, the population was divided 
into three regions, North, Center and South. These regions were the primary 
sampling unit and chosen based on differences in population size, the 
distribution of ethnic groups within a region, age groups, and the region's 
geography, economy, and history. 
Second, inside of each regional stratum, polling stations were identified, 
which constitute the smallest municipal unit and are at the same time a 
unit for voting. These polling stations formed the second level of 
stratification and were divided into three groups according to their size. 
Polling stations were selected randomly from each group. 
In the third and final stage, a random procedure based on 'step-and-go' was 
employed inside polling stations to choose the household. The last person 
to have had their birthday within the household was interviewed. 
In total, 1,213 respondents completed the interview.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN 

The 2017 Dutch election study was administered between March 16, 2017 and 
July 4, 2017. Fieldwork started the day after the Dutch general election 
on March 15, 2017. The study featured a multiple-mode design combining 
face-to-face and mail-back interviews with a separate sample interviewed on
the web drawn from an online panel. Interviews were conducted in Dutch.

Kantar Public (face-to-face) and CentERdata (online panel) were responsible 
for the data collection. For both sampling components, questions were split
across the main post-election interview and a supplementary questionnaire 
containing most CSES-related questions. The CSES sample only includes 
respondents who completed both questionnaires. Samples were drawn 
independently for face-to-face and web interviews. Both samples aim to
represent eligible voters - i.e., Dutch citizens aged 18 years or older.

The face-to-face sample was realized as a probability sample provided by 
Statistics Netherlands (CBS) with population registers as sampling frame. 
Sampling occurred in two steps: First, a sample of municipalities was drawn,
excluding only the small, Northern islands, followed by a sample of 
individuals within those municipalities. Fieldworkers visited respondents 
at home, reading the questions and entering their answers on a tablet. After
completing the main questionnaire, interviewers left a paper drop-off 
questionnaire with the respondent. Respondents were asked to complete this 
questionnaire at their convenience and return it by mail. 
In a final attempt to increase response rates at a late fieldwork stage, a 
small number of respondents were provided with a link to complete the 
supplementary questionnaire online. Eight respondents in the sample made 
use of this opportunity. 
Respondents were initially offered 15 EUR for participation in the survey, 
with the option to donate it to charity. This amount was escalated to a 
maximum of 50 EUR in subsequent rounds of refusal conversion.

The online sample component was drawn randomly from the ongoing "LISS-panel"
(Langlopende Internet Studies voor de Sociale Wetenschappen). Members of the
LISS panel participate in regular online surveys over an extended time 
period. To reach people without a computer or internet access, LISS provides
the option to lend an easy-to-use computer with free internet access. 
Managed by the research agency CentERdata, the LISS panel was launched in 
2007. To maintain the representativeness of the panel, respondents who 
dropped out are replaced by new participants with similar registered 
characteristics. Overall, the panel was refreshed in four subsequent waves
in 2009, 2011-2012, 2013-2014 and 2016-2017. All four refreshment samples 
were based on probability sampling from register data. Further, all but the 
2011-2012 refreshment wave over-sampled difficult-to-reach groups with a 
below-average response in the main recruitment - stratified by household 
type, age, and ethnicity. 
Liss panel respondents were incentivized relative to the length of the 
questionnaire, paid about 5 EUR for filling in a 20-minute questionnaire. 
For this purpose, the questionnaire was broken up into three parts of 
roughly 20 minutes each. Upon completing the main questionnaire, respondents
from the LISS panel were invited to fill in the supplementary questionnaire
as a second online form.

Survey data from both face-to-face and online interviews were supplemented 
with data from population registers for a selected list of demographic 
variables, namely marital status, household income, region of residence and 
country of origin. Respondents provided consent before data collection.   
Generally, register data is based on the most recently available data, 
usually the year preceding data collection. The sample consists of 723 and 
1,180 completed face-to-face and web interviews, respectively.


<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS 

The Dutch Election Study includes a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT and a POLITICAL 
WEIGHT.
The demographic weight (E1010_2) corrects distributions in the sample to
known socio-demographic population characteristics (age, gender, 
municipality's degree of urbanization, region of residence, marital status, 
and country of origin). 
The political weight (E1010_3) builds upon the demographic weight and 
additionally adjusts the sample according to vote choice (party vote shares
and abstention).
Weights were calculated step-wise based on the univariate distribution of 
every characteristic. For every category of the first characteristic, the 
count in the population was first divided by the count in the survey. 
Subsequently, every respondent was assigned a weight reflecting the ratio 
of their category. The sample distribution of the second characteristic was 
calculated after applying weights for the first characteristic. This 
procedure was repeated for every other characteristic. 
All individual weights were then multiplied to obtain a single combined 
weight variable for all characteristics together. In a final step, this 
variable was divided by its mean such that all weights have an average of 1.

The CSES module release is from persons freshly sampled for the New 
Zealand Election Study. Those persons forming a Panel back to the 2014 
election were also given the module questions, but are not included in 
the CSES release. Fieldwork was conducted between September 26, 2017 and 
February 28, 2018. Hence, data collection started three days after the 
general election and lasted for 156 days. The questionnaire was 
administered in English and could be completed via mail or the internet. 

The sample consists of all eligible citizens that registered on the 
electoral roll on the writ day then aged between 18 and older. On the writ 
day, the electoral roll contained about 88% of those eligible. 
Enrollment continued after writ day until the day before the election, 
with the final roll including just over 92% of the eligible population.
Those in prison were excluded from the sample, but as they are not eligible
to enroll or vote, this does not influence the sampling frame. Military 
personnel was included in the sample. The primary mode was mail 
self-completion, and citizens were given the option of completing it by the 
internet. Therefore, members of the population without access to the 
internet were not excluded. 

The survey employed a random sampling procedure based on the electoral
rolls as of August 23. The primary sampling units were four groups where
the roll was segmented into. Those in general electorates 18-30 years, 
those in general electorates 31 and above, those in Maori electorates 
18-30 and those in Maori electorates 31 and above. The young and those in
the Maori electorates were over-sampled to adjust for lower response rates.
The primary sampling units were not randomly selected as they contained 
together the whole roll for sampling. Further stages of selection were
the individuals on the electoral rolls within the four segments. At those
further stages, units were randomly selected. The sample design included
clustering and quota sampling in the sense that it was sampled within the
four segments. The survey used a draw for four small monetary prizes as 
participation incentives. In total, 1,808 interviews were completed.

COVID-19 pandemic. The surveys were conducted by mail or via the internet. 
The fieldwork period began four days after the election on October 17, 2020, 
and lasted 192 days in total. The survey was administered in English, Maori,

the Victory University Research Trust and the New Zealand Electoral 
Commission. A person needed to be registered and above 18 years old to be 
interviewed. The sample did not include institutionalized persons who were 
not eligible to vote and people on the confidential roll (about 1% of the 
eligible population).

The survey employed a random sampling procedure based on the computerized 
electoral rolls. The primary sampling units were individuals nested within 
Maori descent and age. Maori descent and individuals between 18 and 29 were 
over-sampled to adjust for lower response rates. In a further stage of 
selection, the Maori sub-sample was randomly resampled to correspond to the 
percentage on the electoral roll. The sample design thus included 
clustering and stratification by Maori descent and age. Respondents 
received a 20 NZD grocery voucher for their survey participation. For 90% 
of the completed surveys, survey verification checked whether the reported 
age and gender correctly matched. In total, 1,725 interviews were completed.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The study is a post-election survey that was fielded between September 20,
2017, and October 16, 2017. Data collection was realized by Statistics 
Norway, starting nine days after the Norwegian parliamentary election. 

The sampling frame for the study is a two-stage design. In the first stage,
the country was divided into 363 primary sampling units (PSUs) based on
the local municipalities. All PSUs with more than 30,000 inhabitants and
some with a population number between 25,000 and 30,000 constitute
separate strata. For the remaining PSUs, strata were formed as
homogeneously as possible. In the second stage of the sampling, survey 
units (individuals) were drawn from the population register, selected from 
the 109 sampling areas, using systematic random sampling. The sampling 
fraction at the second stage is proportional to the inverse selection 
probability at the first stage. The final sample then is self-weighting 
when both stages are taken into consideration. If a sampled unit from the 
panel sample had moved out of their original PSU, it was still included in 
the sample.

Interviews were conducted in Norwegian via the internet. The sample is 
meant to be representative of the Norwegian citizens aged between 18 and 
91. As the interviews were conducted via the internet, Norwegians without 
internet access were excluded from the sampling frame (2 % of the eligible 
population). Respondents received both an e-mail and a text message. Both 
the email and the text message contained a hyperactive link which, when 
activated, led the respondents straight to the survey, with no need for user
ID or password. It also included general information about the survey and 
its theme. The respondents did not get any incentives for their 
participation in the study. Additional reminders were sent to those who did 
not participate in the survey after the initial contact. 

The CSES module was previously a part of the Norwegian National Election 
Study. However, the CSES module was taken out of the 2017 election survey 
and conducted separately. Thus, none of the respondents was part of a 
previous panel. The sample consisted of 5,000 persons over the age of 18 
drawn randomly from the National registry covering all Norwegian 
inhabitants. As they sampled individuals and not households, more than one 
person could have been interviewed from a single household. From the sample
of 5,000 persons, 1,782 participants completed the interviews. 


<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS 

The 2017 Norwegian Election Study contains a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT. The
weight was constructed after collaborators found that over- and 
under-representation in the survey were related to particular demographic
characteristics. Respondents with higher education were over-represented
compared to those with lower education. Those in the age group 45-66 years
were over-represented as well, whilst the oldest in the sample were
underrepresented. 

The weight adjusts for gender, age, and education, dividing the sample into
18 different strata. Gender contained two categories: male and female. Age
was divided into three categories: 30 years or under, 31 to 59 years, and
60 years and over. Education was also divided into three categories: first
no education/ primary school or unspecified, second high school, and third
university/ college. The stratified weight is set then as equal to the
number of persons in the strata in the population divided by the number of
persons in the strata in the net sample.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2019 Portuguese post-election study was administered between October 12
and December 15, 2019, as a face-to-face survey. Fieldwork was conducted by
GfK Portugal, starting six days after the Portuguese legislative election
held on October 6, 2019. Interviews were conducted in Portuguese.

The sample is meant to be representative of individuals aged 18 years or
older residing in continental Portugal. Portuguese citizenship was not 
required to participate in the interview. The two autonomous regions Madeira
and the Azores were excluded from the sample frame (5 percent of the 
eligible population). The same holds for institutionalized persons (less 
than 1 percent of the eligible population).

The study is based on a multistage stratified random sample. The sample was
stratified according to locality size ("habitat") and EU NUTS II regions; a 
hierarchical geocode standard subdividing the territories of EU member 
states. The NUTS II regions North, Centre, Lisbon, Alentejo, and Algarve 
were also the primary sampling unit. In a first step, the random selection
of localities within each of the five listed NUTS II regions was carried out
following the General Index of INE's Population Census, based on the sample
matrix of NUTS II regions and habitat. In each designated locality, sample
points were then again sampled randomly. Afterward, households were selected
through random route. From within each household, the adult who had the most
recent birthday was selected for the interview in the last step. If the 
selected person was not available, up to three more revisits were made to 
reach the potential interviewee on different days (week and weekend) and 
throughout different times of the day. After a fourth unsuccessful visit, 
the selected individual was replaced by another person with similar 
characteristics (sex, age group and location) from a different household. 
The sample consists of 1,500 completed interviews.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2020 Slovakian Parliamentary elections were held on Saturday, February
29, 2020. The election took place just before the COVID-19 pandemic was 
declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, although fieldwork for the 2020 study 
was conducted during the pandemic. Fieldwork began on June 9, 2020, after
a wait of three months for the government to lift COVID-19 pandemic 
restrictions which made face-to-face interviewing impossible. Fieldwork 
principally lasted 84-days and was completed on August 31, 2020, with 1,003 
respondents completing the questionnaire. Kantar Slovakia conducted the 
fieldwork. Data were collected in-person, face-to-face interviewing using 
an electronic/computerized questionnaire (CAPI). The survey was administered 
in Slovakian. Respondents were citizens living in Slovakia who were 18 years 
old or older. Up to 3% of citizens, homeless, imprisoned, and in senior care
houses, were excluded from the sample frame.

The Slovakian study sample was created by random sampling from the
register of all communities (villages and towns) in Slovakia based on the
proportions of the population of the age 18+ and the size of the community.
In total, 143 territory sampling units were selected. Households in these
units were chosen by a random walk (according to strict rules). Further,
respondents in the household were selected following the closest birthday
method. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic/lockdown, the interviewing took
longer than envisaged, and some PSUs were hard to reach. Because of that,
interviewers could not cover approximately 20% of the PSUs selected in the
original sample. To compensate for this, the Slovakian team agreed they
would do another wave of sampling to collect the missing approximately 33%
of the sample. In the end, 668 respondents answered the survey from the
first round of fieldwork where 20% of PSUs were not visited, and 335
respondents answered the survey in the second round of fieldwork.

The Slovakian Election Study provides a combined SAMPLE and DEMOGRAPHIC
WEIGHT. 
The weight compensates for disproportionate probability of selection and 
additionally adjusts the data to match known demographic characteristics,
namely gender (two categories), age (five categories), region (eight 
categories), education (five categories) and community size (five 
categories). 
Weights were calculated using an iterative proportional fitting algorithm
(raking). After combining the sample with the demographic weight, the 
weight was trimmed to a range between 0.3 and 3.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2016 South Korean cross-sectional post-election study consists of 
face-to-face interviews, which were conducted from April 14 to April 23, 
2016. Fieldwork started the day after the South Korean legislative election 
on April 13, 2016, and was realized by the Korean Social Science Data 
Center. Interviews were conducted in Korean.
The sample is meant to be representative of registered South Korean voters 
aged 19 and above. People living on Cheju Island and other small islands 
were excluded from the sample frame. This is common for Korean national 
surveys, as people living in these regions are difficult to contact and 
make up less than one percent of the population. 

The sample was realized as a multistage random sample, for which electoral 
districts represented the primary sampling units. In the first stage, 80 
electoral districts were randomly sampled from a list of all electoral
districts in South Korea. At the second stage, voting districts within each
sampled electoral district were randomly sampled. In the third and final 
stage, a simple random sample of voters was drawn within each voting 
district, based on electoral registers provided by the Central Election 
Management Committee. When contacting a respondent's household, 
interviewers asked for the name of the respondent and identified her or 
him to be the right person listed. Prior to the study, a token gift 
(folding umbrella) was sent to the sampled individuals. The final dataset 
includes 1,199 completed interviews.

The Swedish 2018 post-election study was administered between September 10
and November 6, 2018, by Statistics Sweden, SCB. Fieldwork started the day
after the Swedish general election on September 9, 2018. Respondents were 
initially contacted via mail and could choose between self-administered 
postal and web interviews. Self-completion questionnaires were provided 
in Swedish.

Unlike Swedish studies from previous CSES Modules included in the Swedish 
National Election Study's traditional post-election surveys, a separate 
sample was drawn for the 2018 CSES edition of the Swedish National Election
Study. That separate CSES sample was conceptualized as a simple random 
sample and is meant to be representative of Swedish citizens living in 
Sweden who were entitled to vote and between 18 and 80 years old. 
Eligible Swedish citizens living abroad were excluded from the sample frame
(about 2% of the population). Individuals were sampled directly from 
population registers provided by Statistics Sweden and were hence the 
primary sampling unit. 

Overall, the sample is composed of 3,784 completed interviews. To encourage
participation, sampled respondents were sent letters to inform them about 
the study's purpose and offered a gift card worth 50 SEK.


<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS

The Swedish Election Study includes a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT. Weights were
calculated using an iterative proportional fitting algorithm (raking).
The demographic weight (E1010_2) adjusts the data to match known demographic
characteristics, namely gender (male, female), age group (18-25, 26-40,
41-64, 65-80), and education (seven categories based on the Swedish
education classification scheme "Svensk utbildningsnomenklatur (SUN)").
In general, collaborators used public register data on respondents to
calculate the demographic weight, with the following exceptions:
For age group, no public records data were available for one respondent, 
and the survey information was used instead.
For education, public records data were unavailable for 857 respondents,
due to the respondents not approving of the use of public records data.
For these 857 individuals, collaborators imputed data based on sex and age
groups. Collaborators note they chose to make imputations based on census
data even though survey data was available because they found an
unexpectedly low correlation between survey responses and census register
data on education in previous analyses. Particularly older age groups tend
to overestimate their formal level of education. To get a cleaner measure,
collaborators hence decided against mixing survey responses with census
data.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2019 Swiss Federal elections were held on Sunday, October 20, 2019.
Fieldwork for the Swiss election study began the day after the election,
on October 21, 2019. Data collection ended after 77 days, on January 5,
2020, with 4,645 respondents completing the survey. FORS - Swiss Center of
Expertise in the Social Sciences conducted the fieldwork. Data was
collected using two modes of interview: Internet and mail-back
self-completion. Namely, all drawn respondents were first invited to fill
in the questionnaire online. With the second reminder (out of three), a 
paper version of the questionnaire was sent to those who had not yet 
participated in the survey. The survey was administered in German, French 
and Italian languages. The sample was designed to be representative of all 
Swiss citizens residing in Switzerland who were at least 18 years old on 
Election Day (October 20, 2019) and thus eligible to vote. Only Swiss 
citizens living abroad were not included in the sample - 3.4% of all 
registered voters.

The sample was drawn by the Federal Statistical Office (FSO) from their
sampling frame of Swiss citizens who were at least 18 years old and
residing in Switzerland at the time of the elections, with individuals as
primary sampling units. The total number of individuals in the sample was
17,866. The sample size was adjusted to have a minimum of at least 80
respondents per canton in each of the 26 cantons (oversampling of small
cantons). Additionally, the cantons of Ticino, Geneva and Zurich are
traditionally over-sampled in the Swiss Election Study in order to have a
larger N for the three main language regions (Italian-speaking,
French-speaking and German-speaking, respectively).


<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS

The Swiss Election Study provides a SAMPLE and a POLITICAL WEIGHT.
The sample weight (E1010_1) corrects for the oversampling of small cantons 
and two larger cantons (Ticino and Zurich). This weight was calculated as 
the quotient of the proportion of eligible voters in the population of each
canton and the proportion of respondents in the sample that falls within
the canton.
The political weight (E1010_3) corrects biases that result from
oversampling, turnout, and party choice in the data. The weight is
calculated by multiplying three weights, namely the Design, Turnout and
Party Choice Weights. The turnout and party choice biases in survey data
are common phenomena in Switzerland.

General elections in Taiwan were held on January 16, 2016. These included 
Taiwan presidential and legislative elections. Fieldwork for the Taiwanese
study started one day after the elections and lasted until April 28, 2016,
in total 103 days. Interviews were conducted by the Election Study Center
at the National Chengchi University. The survey was administered in Chinese,
and respondents were interviewed face-to-face using an electronic
questionnaire (CAPI). Throughout the whole questionnaire for Taiwan (2016),
the additional categories "it depends" and "no opinion" were used apart
from "refuse", "don't know", and "missing." Since these two categories
do not match CSES standards, they were recoded to missing for all variables.

The sample is meant to be representative of all qualified voters in Taiwan.
These are all Taiwanese citizens who are 20 years or older. The survey used 
a probability proportional to size (PPS) three-stage systematic sampling. 
In the first stage, legislative constituencies were sampled according to
major geographic regions. In the second stage, urban villages or rural
villages were selected as sampling units. In the third stage, respondents
were selected from household registration data provided by the Ministry
of the Interior. In total, 7,601 citizens were sampled, out of which 1,690
completed interviews have been collected. All respondents received a
gift as an incentive to participate in the study.

The post-election survey was fielded between January 13 and May 30, 2020. 
The election took place just before the COVID-19 pandemic was declared a 
pandemic on March 11, 2020, although fieldwork for the 2020 study 
was conducted in part during the pandemic. The data was collected by the 
Election Study Center, National Chengchi University and funded by the 
Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST). The survey was conducted 
face-to-face using a computerized questionnaire. 
Interviews were conducted in Chinese. To be interviewed, a person needed 
to be a Taiwanese citizen above 20 years old. Institutionalized persons, 
0.04% of the population, were excluded from the sample as felons are 
ineligible to vote in Taiwan.  

In the first stage of sampling, legislative constituencies were sampled 
according to major geographic regions. In the second stage, urban villages 
or rural villages were selected as sampling units. In the third stage, 
samples were selected from address-based sampling of a geographical
information system (GIS). The final stage was implemented via in-house 
sampling that included two steps. First, the interviewer asked, "how many 
adults who are over 20 years old and whose household registration is at this 
address (regardless of whether they live here or not)?" Second, "among these 
adults, [computer sampling results] is the person we wanted to interview."

To increase the response rate, a notification letter for the interview was  
sent to the respondents in advance, and they received a gift after finishing  
the interview. The sample consists of 1,680 completed interviews.

The interviewers were either college or graduate students from the 
universities or professional interviewers. The organizers introduced the 
interviewers to the standardized face-to-face survey procedure in about 80 
minutes, explained the TEDS2020 questionnaire in about 2 hours, and then 
trained them on how to use the CAPI system on tablet PCs in about 4 hours. 
Altogether, every interviewer received 12 hours of training, containing 
explanation of the questionnaires, standard procedure of interview, 
interview simulation, the use of CAPI and data uploading.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The Thai 2019 study was conceptualized as a post-election face-to-face 
survey conducted between April 25 and June 5, 2019. Fieldwork was 
administered by the King Prajadhipok's Institute and started 32 days after 
the Thai general election held on March 24, 2019. Interviews were conducted
in local Thai dialects and Tribe language. The multi-stage systematic random
sample is meant to represent Thailand's eligible voting population, i.e., 
Thai citizens aged 18 years or above registered to vote.

For this survey, the country was divided into five regions corresponding to
the four regions of Thailand plus the special administrative area of 
Bangkok. 
Within each of the four regions, a list of Amphoe (districts) per region 
was randomly selected for the first sampling stage. These districts served
as the primary sampling units. In the second stage, Tambol (subdistricts)
were randomly selected within each Amphoe. Afterward, a specified number of
villages (Muban) were sampled within each Tambol. The fourth sampling stage
determined the number of people to be surveyed within a village. In each 
stage, the numbers of units to be sampled within a geographic area were 
chosen proportionally to population size within the overlaying geographical
unit. In the final stage, individual respondents were systematically sampled
from lists provided by the Community Department of the Ministry of Interior. 
In Bangkok, a list of sub-districts was randomly selected in the first stage
proportionally to population size. Subsequently, systematic sampling was 
applied to select individual respondents from electoral registers. 
After the interview, respondents received a notebook and a pen to thank
them for their participation. 

Researchers are advised that substitution of individuals was permissible at
the final stage of selection in all five regions. The substitution process
was coordinated by collaborators and applied in cases where interviewers 
could not contact the sampled person due to relocation, decease, illnesses 
etc. Substituted individuals were sampled in the same manner as regular 
respondents, matching the age and gender of the originally sampled person.
The sample consists of 1,536 completed interviews, of which 370 have been
conducted with substituted persons.

The parliamentary elections took place on October 6, 2019, five months  
before the COVID-19 pandemic was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, 
although fieldwork for the 2019 study was conducted during the pandemic.
The post-election survey was fielded between July 18 and July 30, 2020, and
was administered by the polling agency One to One for Research and Polling. 

The COVID-19 pandemic delayed the beginning of fieldwork. The project 
received funding support from the Central European University (CEU) in 
mid-January 2020. As the first election was held on September 15, 2019, 
the interviewing started about 300 days after the election. COVID-19 
restrictions were eased in summer 2020, allowing face-to-face fieldwork
to begin in July 2020. The surveys were then conducted face-to-face using
a computerized questionnaire. The language of the survey administration
was Tunisian Arabic. To be interviewed, a person needed to be a Tunisian
citizen above 18 years old. Institutionalized persons were excluded from
the sample as surveys were only conducted within households.  

The Tunisian study used a stratified multistage probability sample. The 
primary sampling units (PSU) are the smallest units in the sampling frame 
called blocks. The PSUs are randomly selected with the population 
proportional to size method. Tunisia is divided into 24 governorates, 264 
delegations and 2,084 sectors. Each sector was divided into two independent 
categories: urban and rural. The population was classified into 46 strata 
(two governorates, namely Tunis and Monastir, are 100% urban). The sectors 
were then divided into "blocks". The total number of blocks was 27,466. 
The largest administrative unit, namely each governorate, got a portion of 
the sample based on the percentage of the population related to the total 
population. The rural and urban areas in each governorate then received a 
portion from the sampling points based on the percentage of each area 
within the governorate. The three stages of selection were: selecting the 
blocks, selecting households, and selecting respondents. In the final 
stage, the interviewers used the Kish table to randomly select one 
respondent. From one house to another, the interviewers alternated between 
female and male. In total, 1,477 interviews were completed.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The CSES module is part of the Turkish post-election cross-sectional study, 
for which the fieldwork was conducted between July 23 and September 9, 
2018, by Frekans Arastirma. Data collection started 29 days after the 
Turkish General Election on June 24 and lasted for 49 days. 
The questionnaire was administered in person (PAPI) in Turkish. The sample 
is designed to be representative of the Turkish voting-age population
living in urban as well as rural areas  that is, Turkish citizens aged 
18 years or older. Institutionalized persons in prisons or hospitals and
military personnel were excluded from the sampling frame (about 1% of the 
voting-eligible population).

The sample was realized as a stratified multistage random sample. 
NUTS-2 regions, as given by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK), 
formed the basis for stratification. In the first step, the target sample
was stratified according to each region's share of the urban and rural 
population following the Address-Based Population Registration System 
(ADNKS) records as of the end of 2017.
Next, TUIK's address block data were used with block size set at 400 
residents. Address blocks were the primary sampling unit. Twenty voters were
targeted to be reached within each block, and no substitution was allowed. 
Based on the probability proportionate to population size (PPPS) principle,
blocks were distributed to NUT1 regions.
In a third step, for each of the twenty addresses within each block, up to 
three visits were carried out with the expectation that approximately 50% 
of the addresses would result in a completed interview. In rural areas where
TUIK was unable to provide addresses, collaborators contacted the village's
headman (muhtar) and selected twenty addresses in a systematic random sample
from the list of households in the village. 
To select individuals within sampled households, names of all reported 
eligible household members were written on cards. Then, a person in
the household was asked to randomly select one card with the name of the 
individual to be interviewed. If for any reason, the selected individual
could not participate in the survey at the first visit, the same household
was visited up to three times to obtain the interview. If the interview 
could not be realized after three visits, the respective household was 
dropped from the sample without being substituted. Overall, the sample 
includes 1,069 completed interviews.

The 2018 Turkish election study includes a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT. The weight
adjusts the sample to the following known population distributions of
gender, age, and educational attainment: Males and Females, six age groups
(18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64 and 65+-year-olds), and five education
groups (below primary school, primary school graduates, secondary school
graduates, high school graduates, University graduates and above).
The resulting 60 cells (2 x 6 x 5) were filled with the respective
respondents from within the sample to calculate the weight and to obtain 
the national aggregates.
Because there are minor variations in the geographic planned distribution
of observations and realized interviews, collaborators calculated a separate
geographic weight. The demographic weight included in CSES is the product
of this geographic weight and the demographic weight described above.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN 

The American National Election Study (ANES) 2016 Time Series has a pre-
post-election panel design in which respondents were interviewed twice:
Once prior to the election and once after the election. The CSES sample
includes only respondents who took part in both rounds of interviews.
The study features a dual-mode design combining face-to-face interviewing 
with a separate sample interviewed on the Internet. Respondents were 
assigned to modes and did not switch modes between interviews. 
Post-election interviewing featuring the CSES module started on November 9, 
2016 - the day after the General election on November 8 - and continued 
until January 9, 2017. The study was administered by Westat, Inc. in both
English and Spanish.

Probability samples were drawn independently for face-to-face and web 
interviews. Both samples are meant to be representative of U.S. citizens 
aged 18 or older at the time of recruitment. As the sampling frame for both
modes was composed of lists of residential addresses provided by the U.S. 
Postal Service, a respondent had to reside at the sampled address to be 
eligible. Addresses where mail is not delivered were excluded from the 
sampling frame. Residents from the states of Alaska and Hawaii were not 
sampled for face-to-face interviews (less than one percent of the study 
population). Furthermore, addresses associated with more than one dwelling 
unit ("drop point addresses") were excluded from the sampling frame for 
web surveys (2.9 percent of residential addresses). 

The face-to-face sample was realized as a multi-stage stratified cluster 
sample. Primary sampling units (PSUs) were counties, or a combination of
counties, with a minimum population of 50,000 people. The Los Angeles 
County was divided into two PSUs due to its large size. For the 
face-to-face mode, 60 PSUs were selected with probability proportional to 
the number of adult citizens, previously stratified by Census region, the 
prevalence of poverty, members of minority groups and population size. The 
five largest PSUs were selected with certainty.
In a second stage, within each PSU, four Census Block groups were drawn as 
the secondary sampling units. Within these areas, households were sampled 
randomly from addresses included in the U.S. Postal Service's computerized
delivery sequence file (DSF). Interviewers were sent to the sampled address 
and conducted a brief screening interview in which eligible respondents 
from the household were listed. One person was randomly selected from this 
list. During the last two weeks of pre-election fieldwork, half of the 
remaining eligible cases were sub-sampled out to concentrate resources on
a smaller set of cases (adaptive design).
Depending on the level of pre-election incentives, respondents were
initially offered 25, 50 or 100 USD for completing the post-election 
interview. These amounts were increased to 50 or 100 USD, respectively, at
the end of the fielding period.

The web sample is based on a simple random sample from the list from the 
DSF-file, excluding drop point addresses and addresses contacted for the 
ANES pretest. Selected addresses were sent letters asking one household 
member to go online to complete a survey. That survey contained a 
screening instrument to randomly select one person from all eligible 
household members for the final interview. 
For post-election web interviews, incentives were set to the amount paid 
for the pre-election interview, that is, either 40 or 80 USD.

Panel attrition rates were 10 percent for the face-to-face component, and 
16 percent for the web component. The sample consists of 1,058 and 2,590 
completed face-to-face and web interviews, respectively.

>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - UNITED STATES (2020)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN 

The election and the fieldwork for the study took place during the
COVID-19 pandemic. The American National Election Study (ANES) 2020 Time 
Series study has a pre and post-election panel design in which 4,779 
respondents were interviewed twice: Once before the election and once after 
the election. Another 2,670 were sampled for the 2016 ANES time series 
study and were re-interviewed in 2020 before and after the election. 
The CSES sample includes respondents sampled in 2016 and 2020 who took part 
in both rounds of the 2020 interviews.

Post-election interviewing featuring the CSES module started on November 8, 
2020 - five days after the General election on November 3 - and continued 
until January 4, 2021. As the pandemic made face-to-face interviewing 
unfeasible, the 2020 ANES implemented a contactless, sequential mixed-mode 
design. This design combined self-administered online surveys, live video 
interviews, and telephone interviews. Respondents were assigned to modes 
and did not switch modes between interviews. Westat, Inc. administered the
study in either English or Spanish.

The fresh 2020 cross-sectional sample is meant to represent eligible voters
in the 2020 presidential election, as defined by being age 18 as of election
day and being a U.S. citizen. Institutionalized persons were excluded from 
the sampling frame. Further details on the sampling process with which 
panelists from 2016 were recruited are available in this part of the  
Codebook ("Overview of Study Design and Weights - United States (2016)"). 

The 2020 fresh cross-sectional sample is based on a simple random sample
drawn from the computerized delivery sequence file (C-DSF) provided by 
the U.S. Postal Service. All included residential addresses across the 50 
states and Washington DC had an equal probability of selection. 
Selected addresses were sent a series of letters, asking one household 
member to go online to complete a survey. That survey contained a screening 
instrument to randomly select one person from all eligible household members
for the final interview. Upon completion of the screener, the selected 
individual was randomly assigned to one of three sequential mode conditions:
web-only, mixed web, and mixed video.

Cases assigned to the web-only group were released in two replicates for the
pre-election survey and solely interviewed online. The first replicate was
released in mid-August 2020 with the other sample groups. The second 
replicate was released on September 11, 2020, after the Republican and 
Democratic conventions, roughly corresponding to the field period of 
previous ANES Time Series studies.
Respondents in the mixed web group were initially invited to complete the 
survey online. Non-responding persons and refusals were shifted to the 
telephone at the case level in the final weeks of the pre-election period. 
Finally, upon completing the web screener, respondents in the mixed video 
group were invited to complete the survey by live video interview via Zoom. 
Following the invitation link, respondents were instructed to wait briefly
to connect with an interviewer or set an appointment. In case of refusal or 
non-response, respondents were shifted to the web. At the final stage, 
non-respondents to web were subsequently pushed to the phone. Similar to 
the mixed web group, this shift occurred at the case level in the final
weeks of the pre-election period. 
All panelists from the 2016 ANES Time Series study completed the 2020 survey
online. Invitations were made by e-mail and mail.
Respondents from all groups completed the post-election survey in the same
mode as the pre-election survey.

Before the pre-election interview, selected addresses were sent invitation
letters including 10 USD in cash that promised an additional 40 USD for 
completing a survey online. Among all groups of the fresh 2020 sample, 
non-responding households were offered escalated incentives of 100 USD for 
completing the screener later in the field period. Additionally, individuals
from under-represented groups with a low response rate were offered 200 USD
as part of a targeted, adaptive design approach in the mixed-web group and 
for panelists from 2016. Likewise, to counter initial non-response, 200 USD
escalations were offered to respondents from the mixed video group for 
completing interviews by video. 
For the post-election survey, pre-election respondents were offered the 
incentive amount they received previously.

The pre-election re-interview rate for the 2016-2020 panel cases was 77.9%.
Of these, post-election re-interviews were conducted with 94.0% of 
panelists. The cumulative 2020 re-interview rate was thus 73.2%.
For the fresh 2020 sample, 87.9% of respondents from the pre-election survey
also completed the post-election interview (88.1% in web-only, 88.7% in 
mixed web and 84.6% in the mixed video group, respectively). 
The resulting combined post-election sample consists of 7,449 completed 
interviews.


<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS 

The American National Election Study includes a combined DEMOGRAPHIC and
SAMPLE WEIGHT. The weight adjusts for unequal probability of selection, 
non-response, age by gender, marital status by gender, race/ethnicity by 
educational attainment, race/ethnicity by Census region, nation of birth, 
home tenure by metropolitan status, population density, household income, 
and early voter status.
The weight deposited with CSES (variable V200010b in the ANES 2020 Time 
Series data) is targeted to the full post-election dataset, namely all three
mode conditions from the 2020 fresh cross-sectional sample and sample 
members from the 2016 ANES Time Series Study. Users interested in conducting
analyses with a subset of these sample components only are referred to the 
ANES 2020 Time Series Study, which provides individual weights for selected 
components.

Weights were calculated following a complex multistage procedure involving 
raking and the trimming of large weights. Users interested in the detailed 
step-by-step approach for creating weights are referred to the Design Report
for the United States 2020, available for download on the CSES website.

<<>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - URUGUAY (2019)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The Uruguayan Election Study was carried out between January 28, and  
February 27, 2020. Interviews were conducted by telephone. The fieldwork  
period began 94 days after the first round of the presidential election and  
took 31 days. The questionnaire was administered in Spanish, and the  
Instituto Factum carried out the fieldwork. A person needed to be registered  
and a citizen above 18 years old to be interviewed. As interviews were  
conducted by telephone, about 6% of the eligible population was excluded  
because citizens did not have phones. 
 
The primary sampling units were departments. The departments were selected 
proportionally to the electorates and hence not randomly. Individuals in 
the departments were selected randomly. Apart from clustering by 
departments, the sample design includes quota sampling by sex and age. 
Interview verification was used, where supervisors randomly listened to all 
recorded interview audios and compared them with the database. 100% of the 
completed surveys were verified. In total, 1,200 interviews were completed.


<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS 

The 2019 Uruguayan Election Study provides three weights: a SAMPLE WEIGHT, 
a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT, and a POLITICAL WEIGHT. The sample weight is designed 
to account for a sampling bias related to the different Uruguayan 
territories (based on variable E2022 - Rural or Urban Residence). The 
demographic weight controls for gender and age. The political weight 
adjusts for discrepancies in the reported electoral behavior of respondents 
and the official electoral results.
