))) IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING ADVANCE RELEASES
===========================================================================


This dataset and all accompanying documentation is the "Fourth Advance 
Release" of CSES Module 5 (2016-2021).

By definition, an Advance Release is a preliminary version of a dataset,
and thus lacks some of the checking, cleaning, processing, documentation,
data, and variables that are usual to the Full Release of a dataset. Many
election studies that will eventually be present in the CSES Module 5 Full
Release are not available in this file.

Advance Releases are provided as a service to the CSES user community,
for those analysts who find it valuable to work with preliminary versions
of the dataset. We would appreciate being notified of any errors in the
dataset or documentation by email to "cses@umich.edu".

Users should expect future changes and improvements to the naming, data,
and documentation of variables and election studies that appear in an
Advance Release file. If users wish to re-use their programming code on
a future release of the file, the code should be written in a way that is
flexible and can be accommodating of these future changes.

Users of the Advance Release may also wish to monitor the errata for 
CSES Module 5 on the CSES website, to check for known errors which 
may impact their analyses. To view errata for CSES Module 5, go to Data
Download on the CSES website, navigate to the CSES Module 5 download page, 
and click on the Errata link in the white box to the right of the page.

We hope that until such time as the Full Release of CSES Module 5 is
available, users will find this and future CSES Module 5 Advance Releases
to be helpful in their work.

))) LIST OF TABLES IN CODEBOOK PART 4
===========================================================================

Below, we list the Tables located in Codebook Part 4. Tables can be 
accessed in the electronic version of the CSES Codebook by searching for
"+++".

     ELECTORAL DISTRICTS REPRESENTED IN CSES DATA


===========================================================================
))) OVERVIEW OF "CODEBOOK PART 4: PRIMARY ELECTORAL DISTRICTS" 
===========================================================================

Part 4 of the CSES Codebook presents the primary electoral districts by
polity, which refer to the constituency/riding/district in which an 
individual respondent in a survey votes. 
These value labels refer to coders reported in variable 
E2021 "PRIMARY ELECTORAL DISTRICT" detailed in CSES Codebook Part 2. 

These districts are sometimes identified "indirectly," through postal 
codes, etc... by the CSES Secretariat with the assistance of the 
national collaborators. Where postal codes, etc., were ambiguous,
cases are coded missing. Wherever possible, CSES uses the labels used 
by each country's electoral commission. 

Only districts where respondents are in the CSES data are listed (see 
second column of Table below). Polities are listed in alphabetical order.

))) HOW TO NAVIGATE THE CSES MODULE 5 CODEBOOK
===========================================================================

In the CSES Module 5 dataset, all variables begin with the letter "E" 
(E being the fifth letter of the English alphabet and thus signifying 
Module 5).

The CSES codebook is especially extensive and users are advised that the 
best way to navigate it is electronically. It is a .txt format which 
allows it to be accessed via a variety of programs. 

The CSES Codebook can be navigated quickly in the electronic files, with 
the following commands allowing for quick searching:

))) = Section Header 

>>> = Sub-section Header 1

<<>> = Sub-section Header 2 

+++ = Tables

VARIABLE NOTES = Notes for particular variables 

ELECTION STUDY NOTES = Notes for a particular election study  

DERIVATIVE VARIABLE = Highlights a variable derived from another 
variable or variables within the CSES.

POTENTIAL POLITY LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging at polity level.

POTENTIAL REGIONAL LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging at regional level.

POTENTIAL TIME BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging by time.

POTENTIAL PARTY/COALITION LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable 
that may be used for data bridging at party/coalition level.

POTENTIAL CSES PRODUCT BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable 
that may be used for data bridging with other CSES products.

For further details on the CSES Module 5 documentation, users are advised
to consult Part 1 of the CSES Codebook.

         | In the sampling procedure, Belgium collaborators selected 4,000
         | addresses in the Wallonia from the National Register. Primary
         | electoral districts are derived from postal codes, which were
         | reported by respondents themselves. Thus, some respondents report
         | to be from Brussels, even though Brussels was not sampled for the
         | Belgium - Wallonia (2019) study. Primary electoral districts
         | remain unchanged, and district data is added as if these
         | respondents are from Brussels.

         | Further, discrepancies between sampling regions and electoral

         |                                              DISTRICTS
         |
         | District data given in E4001-E4007 refer to the U.S. 2016 
         | Presidential election, while codes listed above indicate 
         | Congressional Districts.
         | For Presidential elections, the United States use an electoral
         | college system, a system which sees the Presidential candidate
         | who wins in a state awarded its electoral college votes (except
         | for Maine and Nebraska where electoral votes are awarded on the
         | basis of who wins congressional districts within the state).
         | Hence, the first three digits of electoral district codes above 
         | refer to the state the respondent resided in. 
         | Together with the first three digits, the last two digits 
         | specify Congressional Districts, which are also listed
         | after the state name. 
         | U.S. states, the geographical level E4001-E4007 refer to, are 
         | provided in E2020 (REGION OF RESIDENCE).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (2020): PRIMARY ELECTORAL
         |                                              DISTRICTS
         |                                        
         | District data given in E4001-E4007 refer to the U.S. 2020  
         | Presidential elections, while codes listed above indicate 
         | Congressional Districts.
         | For Presidential elections, the United States use an electoral
         | college system, a system which sees the Presidential candidate
         | who wins in a state awarded its electoral college votes (except
         | for Maine and Nebraska, where electoral votes are awarded on the
         | basis of who wins congressional districts within the state).
         | Hence, the first three digits of electoral district codes above 
         | refer to the state the respondent resided in. 
         | Together with the first three digits, the last two digits 
         | specify Congressional Districts, which are also listed
         | after the state name. 
         | U.S. states, the geographical level E4001-E4007 refer to, are 
         | provided in E2020 (REGION OF RESIDENCE).
