))) IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING ADVANCE RELEASES  
===========================================================================

This dataset and all accompanying documentation is the "Fourth Advance 
Release" of CSES Module 5 (2016-2021).

By definition, an Advance Release is a preliminary version of a dataset,
and thus lacks some of the checking, cleaning, processing, documentation,
data, and variables that are usual to the Full Release of a dataset. Many
election studies that will eventually be present in the CSES Module 5 Full
Release are not available in this file.

Advance Releases are provided as a service to the CSES user community,
for those analysts who find it valuable to work with preliminary versions
of the dataset. We would appreciate being notified of any errors in the
dataset or documentation by email to "cses@umich.edu".

Users should expect future changes and improvements to the naming, data,
and documentation of variables and election studies that appear in an
Advance Release file. If users wish to re-use their programming code on
a future release of the file, the code should be written in a way that is
flexible and can be accommodating of these future changes.

Users of the Advance Release may also wish to monitor the errata for
CSES Module 5 on the CSES website, to check for known errors which
may impact their analyses. To view errata for CSES Module 5, go to Data
Download on the CSES website, navigate to the CSES Module 5 download page,
and click on the Errata link in the white box to the right of the page.

We hope that until such time as the Full Release of CSES Module 5 is
available, users will find this and future CSES Module 5 Advance Releases
to be helpful in their work.


===========================================================================
))) OVERVIEW OF "CODEBOOK PART 5: ELECTION SUMMARIES"
===========================================================================

Part 5 of the CSES Codebook presents users with a summary compiled by the 
CSES Secretariat of each polity's election. The overviews provide details
of the type(s) of elections, the dates, the parties/candidates that won 
or lost and any additional relevant campaign information. 

We also provide sources for further information on the election in 
question, sources which helped inform us in devising the summaries,
and which users are encouraged to check for more detailed information
on the elections. 

Election Summaries are listed in alphabetical order of the polity. 


===========================================================================
))) HOW TO NAVIGATE THE CSES MODULE 5 CODEBOOK
===========================================================================

In the CSES Module 5 dataset, all variables begin with the letter "E" 
(E being the fifth letter of the English alphabet and thus signifying 
Module 5).

The CSES Codebook is especially extensive and users are advised that the 
best way to navigate it is electronically. It is a .txt format which 
allows it to be accessed via a variety of programmes. 

The CSES Codebook can be navigated quickly in the electronic files, with 
the following commands allowing for quick searching:

))) = Section Header 

>>> = Sub-section Header 1

<<>> = Sub-section Header 2 

+++ = Tables

VARIABLES NOTES = Notes for particular variables 

ELECTION STUDY NOTES = Notes for a particular election study  

DERIVATIVE VARIABLE = Highlights a variable derived from another 
variable or variables within the CSES.

POTENTIAL POLITY LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging at polity level.

POTENTIAL REGIONAL LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging at regional level.

POTENTIAL TIME BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging by time.

POTENTIAL PARTY/COALITION LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable 
that may be used for data bridging at party/coalition level.

POTENTIAL CSES PRODUCT BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable 
that may be used for data bridging with other CSES products.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - AUSTRALIA (2019)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2019 Australian federal election was held on Saturday, May 18, 2019.
In the House of Representatives (lower house), 151 seats were contested, 
an increase of one on the 2016 elections, while the Senate (upper house) 
elections saw 40 of the 76 seats up for grabs. In Australia, there is 
compulsory voting, and the turnout among registered voters was 91.9%.

In the lower house elections, the Liberal/National Coalition (L/NP), led by 
Scott Morrisson, who had assumed the prime ministership after Malcolm 
Turnbull was deposed as Liberal leader in August 2018, defied the opinion
polls in the lead up to the contest to win a third successive term for the
Coalition. It won 77 seats, an increase of one seat compared to its 2016
performance, and formed a majority government. The opposition Labor Party
(ALP), led by Bill Shorten, trailed on 68 seats with Shorten resigning the 
leadership on election night, to be later replaced by Anthony Albanese. 
Meanwhile, in the Senate elections, the Liberal-National Coalition gained 
five seats, primarily at the expense of smaller parties. The Coalition 
controls now 35 seats in the Upper House, just short of a majority. The 
Greens and the smaller parties maintain the balance of power.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - AUSTRIA (2017)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2017 Austrian Federal lower house election took place on Sunday, 
October 15, 2017. The turnout rate among eligible voters was 80.0%. 
The election took place early after rising tensions between the incumbent
coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPO) and the Christian Democrats 
(OVP). In May 2017, the OVP leader and Austrian Vice-Chancellor, Reinhold 
Mitterlehner resigned after internal party disagreements. Foreign Minister,
the youthful Sebastian Kurz, became the leader of the OVP and called for
snap elections, thus dissolving the grand coalition. 

In the elections, Kurz's OVP, running under the name "List Sebastian Kurz,
the New People's Party," secured 31.5% of the votes, an increase of 
7.5-points compared to the previous election in 2013. The OVP became the 
largest party in parliament for the first time since 2002, surpassing its
coalition partner, the SPO, who held their own in the election, winning 
52 seats and 26.9% of the vote. In third place, the Freedom Party (FPO) 
made gains, winning 11 additional seats. The Green Party (Gruene) failed
to surpass the 4 percent threshold, and, for the first time in 21 years,
did not secure a seat in parliament, losing 24 seats compared with their 
2013 performance. Two other parties, the New Austria (NEOS) and the newly
formed Peter Pilz List (PILZ), gained seats. 

After the election, negotiations between the OVP and FPO led to the first
OVP-FPO government since 2005, ending ten years of grand coalitions led by
the SPO. Sebastian Kurz became Chancellor in December 2017.

<<>> ELECTION SUMMARY - BELGIUM-FLANDERS (2019)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2019 Federal elections in Belgium were held on Sunday, May 26, 2019.
On the same day, European Parliament and regional elections were also held. 
In the Federal elections, Belgium voters elected all 150 members of the 
Chamber of Representatives from eleven multi-member constituencies. Out of 
the total number, 87 representatives are elected in Belgium-Flanders (not
including the Brussels district). 
Based on the electoral register, turnout was 89.72% of registered voters in
Belgium-Flanders (overall, the turnout rate in the whole of Belgium was 
88.38%). Belgium has compulsory voting, meaning that all Belgium citizens 
aged 18 and over are obliged to participate in the election.

The 2019 Federal elections in Belgium saw a decline in the support of
ruling parties, with both CD&V and Open Vld losing votes. The New Flemish
Alliance (N-VA), a party campaigning on Flemish separatism and nationalism,
won the most votes in Flanders (16.03% of the vote share), although their
support was down on their 2014 performance. The 2019 elections saw a
resurgence of the Vlaams Belang (VB) in Flanders, a far-right party, which
nearly equaled its previous best performance in 2007, scoring 18.7% of the
Flanders vote (11.9% of the Belgian vote overall). 

Months of coalition negotiations followed with Sophie Wilmes, a member of
the Reformist Movement (Belgium-Wallonia) leading a caretaker minority 
coalition in the interim, in the process becoming Belgium's first female 
prime minister. In October 2020, a new coalition consisting of 7 parties: 
Open Vld, SPA, CD&V, and Groen from Belgium-Flanders and the PS, MR, and 
Ecolo from Belgium-Wallonia was formed with Alexander De Croo, former 
finance minister and member of the Open-VLD, as the new prime minister.

<<>> ELECTION SUMMARY - BELGIUM-WALLONIA (2019)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2019 Federal elections in Belgium were held on Sunday, May 26, 2019.
On the same day, European Parliament and regional elections were also held
in Belgium. In the Federal elections, Belgium voters elected all 150 members
of the Chamber of Representatives from eleven multi-member constituencies.
Out of the total number, 48 representatives are elected in Belgium-Wallonia.
Based on the electoral register, turnout was 86.35% of registered voters in

88.38%). Belgium has compulsory voting, meaning that all Belgium citizens
aged 18 and over are obliged to participate in the election.

The 2019 Federal elections in Belgium saw a decline in the support of
ruling parties, with the incumbent Reformist Movement (MR), who contest
primarily in Wallonia, losing six seats and coming second in the 
popular vote in Belgium-Wallonia. The Parti Socialist (PS) topped the poll, 
winning 26.1% of the Wallonia vote (9.5% of the Belgian vote overall). 
The Workers' Party of Belgium (PVDA-PTB) and the Green Ecolo party made the 
most significant gains in the election in Wallonia, with Ecolo coming
third, an increase of seven seats on the 2014 performance.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - BRAZIL (2018)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2018 Brazilian general elections were held on Sunday, October 7, 2018 
(first round) with a second round of Presidential elections on Sunday, 
October 28, 2018. Voters in Brazil elected the President, the Vice President
and the National Congress (lower and upper houses). Elections for state 
governors and vice governors, state legislative assemblies and the 
Legislative Chamber of the Federal District were also held at the same time.  
Voting is compulsory for eligible citizens aged 18-70. The turnout in the 
presidential elections in round 1 was 79.7% and in round 2 was 78.7%. 

The elections took place after the successful impeachment of the Workers'
Party (PT) Dilma Rousseff as President in 2015 on charges of breaking 
budgetary laws. Rousseff had been re-elected for a second term in 2014. 
Vice President Michel Temer of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (MDB) 
succeeded her, although he was prohibited from contesting in 2018 due to 
his conviction for campaign violation laws, banning him from holding any 
other public office for eight years. 
Meanwhile, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Workers' Party (PT), who served 
as Brazilian president between 2003-11, announced he would contest the 
2018 Presidential contest. However, he was imprisoned due to a corruption 
scandal and the Brazilian Superior Electoral Court denied his candidacy on 
August 31, 2018. 
In a controversial and charged political environment, Jair Bolsonaro of the 
Social Liberal Party (PSL) emerged as the winner and new president, with 
55.13% of valid votes in the second round, beating Fernando Haddad of 
Workers' Party (PT). Bolsanaro was a controversial candidate, and during
the campaign was criticized for what some deemed inappropriate remarks. He
was stabbed during the campaign at a rally in Minas Gerais, an attack
which was widely condemned.

<<>> ELECTION SUMMARY - CANADA (2019)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 43rd Canadian general election took place on Monday, October 21, 2019,  
to elect members of the lower house of Canada (The House of Commons). The 
turnout among registered voters was 67.04%.

The governing Liberal Party (Lib), led by incumbent Prime Minister Justin 
Trudeau, remained the largest party and stayed in government, but lost the 
majority they had won in 2015. With 157 seats and 33% of the vote, the 
Liberal Party formed a minority government, despite having lost the popular 
vote to the Conservative Party. The Conservative Party (Con) led by Andrew 
Scheer gained 34% of the vote and 121 seats, an increase of 26 on its 
2015 score. 

The Bloc Quebecois (BQ), a regional party only contesting seats in Quebec, 
advanced by winning 7.3% of the popular vote nationally, but one third of 
the vote in Quebec, gaining 22 additional seats and 32 in total. They became
the third largest party in the House of Commons for the first time since 
2008. The vote share of the New Democratic Party (NDP) diminished to 16%, 
with the party winning only 24 seats, its worst performance since 2004. The 
Green Party achieved its best election results with 6.6% of the votes and 
three seats. The People's Party, contesting for the first time on a largely 
populist platform, did not win any seats. Its leader, Maxime Bernier, who 
had previously contested the Conservative Party leadership, losing out to 
Andrew Scheer, lost his seat in Beauce, Quebec.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - CHILE (2017)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Chilean general elections were held on Sunday, November 19, 2017. 
Voters went to the polls to elect a president, the Chamber of Deputies 
(lower house), 23 of the 43 Senate members (upper house), as well as
regional boards. 

In the presidential elections, 46.6% of registered voters voted in the first
round, but no candidate won the required majority, necessitating a 
second round on Sunday, December 17, 2017.  Turnout increased slightly in 
the second round to 49%, as the opposition candidate and former President 
Sebastian Pinera (having served as president between 2010-2014), defeated 
Alejandro Guillier, representing The Force of Majority coalition, which held 
the presidency before the 2017 elections. 

The legislative elections were the first held since the electoral reform of
2015, whereby a more proportional system replaced the binomial electoral 
system in operation since 1989. In the Chamber of Deputies, the Chile Vamos 
coalition, led by National Renewal (RN) and Independent Democratic Union 
(UDI), won the most seats - 72, gaining 23 seats compared to their  
performance in 2013. The governing New Majority alliance lost
its majority in both houses of the Chilean Parliament

<<>> ELECTION SUMMARY - COSTA RICA (2018)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2018 Costa Rica general election took place on Sunday, February 4, 2018
to elect both the President and the Legislative Assembly. The second round 
of the Presidential election was held on Sunday, April 1, 2018. Turnout 
among registered voters was 65.7% in the first round, and slightly higher 
at 66.5% in the second round. 

Incumbent president Luis Guillermo Solis Rivera was term limited and could
not seek re-election (in Costa Rica, an incumbent president only becomes
eligible to contest the presidency again eight years after leaving office). 
In Round 1 of the presidential elections, the two candidates with the most
votes advanced to Round 2, namely Fabricio Alvarado Munoz from the National 
Restoration Party and Carlos Alvarado Quesada from the Citizens' Action 
Party, both of whom achieved 25% and 22% of the vote respectively in Round 
1. In the run-off, Carlos Alvarado Quesada prevailed with 60.6% of the 
votes. Same-sex marriage was a prominent issue in the campaign after 
a ruling by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights required Costa Rica 
to recognize same-sex unions. Alvardo Quesada campaigned in the election
to honor the Court's decision. He became the youngest Costa Rica president
to assume office at aged 38 when sworn into office in May 2018. Meanwhile, 
the previously dominant National Liberation Party received its worst ever 
result, with presidential candidate Antonio Alvarez Desanti finishing a 
distant third, with 18% of the vote in Round 1, and failing to advance to 
the run-off. 

In the legislative assembly, comprising 57 seats, and elected through a 
closed list proportional representation system, despite suffering its 
worst result ever (winning only 19.5% of the vote), the National Liberation 
Party won the most seats (17). The National Restoration Party scored its
best result ever, winning 18.1% of the vote, and 14 seats, to take second
place, the best result ever for a religious party in Costa Rica history. 
The Citizens' Action Party won 10 seats, down three on its 2014 performance
while the Social Christian Unity Party won 9 seats.

<<>> ELECTION SUMMARY - DENMARK (2019)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2019 Danish general election took place on Wednesday, June 5, 2019, to 
elect all 179 members of the Folketing, the Danish unicameral legislature. 
The turnout rate among registered voters was 84.6% (mainland Denmark).
Incumbent prime minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen contested for re-election. 
In 2015, his party Venstre (V) had started the previous term with a single- 
party minority government. In 2016, a coalition government dubbed the 
"blue bloc" formed consisting of the Liberal Alliance (LA). the  
Conservative People's Party (KF), and Venstre, which was supported by the 
Danish People's Party (DF). 

Although Venstre improved on its 2015 performance by gaining 23.1% of
the vote and 43 seats (an increase of nine), other parties in the blue bloc 
suffered setbacks. The Danish People's Party (DF) lost more than half their 
seats, scoring only 16 seats, their worst result since 1998. The Liberal 
Alliance was reduced to 4 seats, having won 13 in 2015. Meanwhile, the
Conservative People's Party won more seats (up to 12 from six in 2015), 
but leaving the blue bloc short of a parliamentary majority. 

In contrast, the Social Democratic Party (S), traditionally the biggest
member of the leftist "red bloc", emerged as the largest party, winning 
25.9% of the vote and 48 seats. The Danish Social Liberal Party (RV) 
doubled its seat share by obtaining 16 seats (up from 8), as did the 
Socialist People's Party (SF, 14 seats, up from 7). 

After the election, Queen Margrethe II tasked the leader of the Social 
Democratic Party, Mette Fredriksen, with forming a new government. 
Frederiksen formed a single-party minority government supported 
by RV and SF, and took office as Denmark's new prime minister on June 27, 
2019.

<<>> ELECTION SUMMARY - FINLAND (2019)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2019 Finnish Parliamentary election took place on Sunday, April 14, 
2019. Voters elected 200 members to the Finnish Parliament. Turnout in the 
2019 elections were 68.7%, up two percentage points compared to the turnout
in the 2015 elections.

Three center-right parties formed the incumbent government. It was
led by the Center Party (KESK, the biggest party before the 2019 election), 
along with The Finns Party (PS) and National Coalition Party (KOK). Their
coalition was shaken by crisis in 2017 when Centre Party and National 
Coalition Party said that they would no longer co-operate with the Finns 
Party after Jussi Halla-aho was elected Finns Party Chairman. Halla-aho was 
an outspoken critic of immigration in Finland and had made other 
controversial statements in his online blog before assuming the party 
leadership. After his election, 21 sitting members of the Finns Party left 
the party, and formed a new party Blue Reform (SIN), which continued to 
support the governing coalition until the 2019 elections, ensuring KESK
and KOK maintained a majority. 

The Center Party (KESK) and the new Blue Reform (SIN) were the biggest 
losers of the 2019 elections. The Center Party lost 18 seats in Parliament, 
while Blue Reform lost all its MPs. The Social Democratic Party (SDP) 
emerged as the biggest party after the 2019 elections, and went on to form a
coalition government with the Center Party (KESK), Green League (VIHR), the
Left Alliance (VAS) and the Swedish People's Party (RKP). Anti Rinne of 
the Social Democratic Party (SDP) became Prime Minister.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - FRANCE (2017)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2017 French Presidential elections were held across two rounds: The
first round was held on Sunday, April 23, 2017, and the second-round 
run-off held on Sunday, May 7, 2017. For the first time in the French Fifth
Republic, the incumbent President, Francois Hollande of the Socialist 
Party (PS), who had been first elected in 2012, announced in December 2016
he would not seek a second term, a decision made in light of continued 
low approval ratings. 

In the first round, eleven candidates competed for the Presidency, with the 
top four coming in close together on a turnout of 77.8%. Emmanuel Macron, 
the former Economy and Industry Minister in the Socialist cabinet of Manuel 
Vallas (2014-16), competing for his newly-founded liberal party, La 
Republique en Marche (The Republic Onwards, LaREM), came first with 24% of
the vote. He was followed closely by Marine Le Pen of the Front National
(FN) on 21.3%. Francois Fillon, former Prime Minister and candidate of the
leading right party The Republicans, came third with 19.6%, his campaign 
having been dogged by corruption allegations. In fourth, Jean-Luc Melenchon
of the leftist Indomitable France scored 19.6%. 

Macron and Le Pen advanced to the run-off election, a contest that for the 
first time since 1974 contained a candidate from neither the traditional
rightist or leftist parties. On a turnout of 74.6%, Macron was elected
President, defeating Le Pen in a landslide, scoring 66.1% of the popular 
vote. He assumed the presidency in May 2017, and called fresh Parliamentary
elections in June 2017, which his newly formed LaREM won.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - GERMANY (2017)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2017 German Federal election to the lower house was held on Sunday, 
September 24, 2017. 76.2% of registered voters voted. The 
incumbent Chancellor Angela Merkel fought for a fourth term in office as
the joint candidate of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its sister
party, the Christian Social Union (CSU - together the Union). 

Despite remaining the strongest parliamentary group with a vote share of 
32.9%, the Union parties experienced a significant loss of votes, scoring
its worst result since 1949. Likewise, the Union's outgoing coalition
partner, the Social Democratic Party (SPD) suffered its worst 
electoral performance in post-war history, only gaining 20.5% of the vote. 
Making a return to parliament after failing to pass the electoral threshold
in 2013, the Liberals (FDP), under Christian Linder, won 10.7%. Meanwhile, 
the radical party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) entered the parliament
for the first time in history with a vote share of 12.6%, scoring third 
place. 

Due to the shrinking vote share of the two traditional of the major party 
blocs, two additional parties in parliament and the SPD's initial
announcement to break with the Grand Coalition, government formation was 
unprecedentedly challenging. After failed exploratory talks between the 
Union parties, the Liberals, and the Greens, the Federal President of 
Germany acted as a facilitator, and initiated the first meetings between the 
Union and the Social Democrats. Following lengthy negotiations and a vote
by SPD-members on the coalition agreement, the Grand Coalition was 
re-constituted with Angela Merkel beginning a fourth successive term 
as Chancellor on March 14, 2018.

<<>> ELECTION SUMMARY - GREAT BRITAIN (2017)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2017 British general election took place on Thursday, June 8, 2017, to 
elect the members of the House of Commons, two years after the previous 
general election in 2015. An election had not been due until May 2020 under
the Fixed Term Parliament Act, ratified in 2011. However, the new prime
minister Theresa May, who had come to power in July 2016 after David 
Cameron's resignation as Conservative Party leader in the aftermath of 
Brexit referendum, wanted a larger parliamentary majority to strengthen 
her negotiating position with the European Union. The House of Commons 
voted to dissolve itself in April 2017, surpassing the two thirds majority
required to trigger early elections. 

The turnout in the elections among registered voters was 68.8% and resulted
in a disappointing result for the incumbent Conservative Party, who won
42.4% of the vote, but lost 13 seats, winning 317, nine short of a
parliamentary majority. The Labor Party, led by the self identified 
socialist Jeremy Corbyn, defied expectations, winning 40% of the popular 
vote, the best result for the party since 2001 in vote share, and winning
an additional 30 seats, although it was still far from obtaining a majority. 
The Liberal Democrats, campaigning on a strong pro-EU platform, diminished 
to 7.4% and 12 seats resulting in a smaller overall vote share but an 
increase of four seats. Meanwhile in Scotland, the Scottish National 
Party (SNP) fell back on its historic performance in the 2015 contests. 
While it remained the largest party in Scotland, the party lost 21 seats, 
winning 35 this time around. The vote share of the UK Independence 
Party (UKIP), the third-largest party in 2015 by votes, decreased from 12.6% 
to 1.8% and lost its only seat. In Wales, Plaid Cymru (PC) gained four sets 
increasing them by one additional. The Green Party (GP) retained its only 
seat.

The election resulted in the Conservative Party remaining in power 
after Prime Minister Theresa May negotiated a confidence and supply 
agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), a Northern Ireland 
religious party.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - GREECE (2015)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Parliamentary elections in Greece were held on Sunday, September 20, 2015.
These were the second Parliamentary elections in Greece within the year, 
with an election previously held in January 2015. It was the sixth general
election in Greece since 2007, a country still dealing with the 
catastrophic aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). 

The elections were called after Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras agreed a new
European Stability Mechanism for Greece in July 2015. Initially, his 
government struggled to convince the Parliament to accept the deal. 
Eventually the deal was passed, with the help of opposition parties 
but more than 40 SYRIZA (main government party) MPs voted against the deal.
Tsipras tendered his resignation as Prime Minister shortly afterwards.

Turnout in the elections was 56.2%, seven percentage points lower than the
January poll, and the lowest turnout recorded in a Greek election since
the restoration of democracy in 1974. SYRIZA and its coalition partner ANEL
surprised many by retaining their majority in the Greek Parliament, with 
SYRIZA falling just six seats short of winning an overall majority in its 
own right. Six other won parliament representation, with New Democracy (ND)
the biggest opposition party. Tsipras remained Prime Minister.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - HONG KONG (2016)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2016 elections to the Hong Kong Legislative Council (LegCo) were held
on Sunday, September 4, 2016. In total, 70 seats were at stake. The CSES 
covers vote choice for the 35 seats that were elected by geographical
constituencies where all eligible voters can cast a ballot. The remaining 
35 seats were returned by functional constituencies (FCs), for which 
representatives of interest groups constitute the electorate (traditional 
FCs, 30 seats), or all remaining voters who are not a member of one of the 
traditional FCs (District Council FC, five seats).    

The 2016 LegCo election was the first election after the Occupy Central 
Movement in 2014, a movement of 79-day protests against the blocking of the 
electoral reform meant to introduce universal suffrage in electing Hong 
Kong's highest government official, the Chief Executive. A record high of 
58.3% of registered voters turned out to vote in the GCs. 

Overall, despite losing three seats, the pro-Beijing camp secured its
majority in the LegCo, keeping 40 of the 70 seats. Inside the pro-Beijing 
camp, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong
(DAB) remained the strongest party by winning 12 seats, seven of these in 
the geographical constituency election. While the pan-democrats group won
23 seats, localists emerged as a new force in the LegCo, increasing their
seat share from one to six, all gained in the geographical constituencies.

The 2018 Hungarian Parliamentary election took place on Sunday, April 8, 
2018. Turnout was 69.7% of all registered voters, up 8-points on the 2014 
elections. The outgoing governing alliance of Fidesz and the Christian 
Democrats (KDNP) won the election, with 49.3% of votes, maintaining its two
thirds majority in parliament it had obtained in 2014. The coalition had 
strongly campaigned on their opposition to immigration and a Eurosceptic 
nationalist platform. 

The Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) scored its worst performance since 
1990, falling to third place winning only 11.9% of the vote, and losing
12 seats, the third successive election where it lost votes. Leader Gergely
Karacsony quit the leadership. Main opposition party Jobbik also saw its 
leader Gabor Vona resign after the election. 

While the incumbent government's victory was marked by protests in the 
capital Budapest on April 14, 2018, Orban was elected to a third successive
term as Prime Minister on May 10, 2018, his fourth in all as he served

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - ICELAND (2016)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2016 Icelandic lower house election took place on Saturday, October 29, 
2016. The poll was triggered approximately one year earlier than anticipated
following the resignation of Prime Minister Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson 
(Progressive Party) in the wake of mass protests with revelations of 
financial scandal emanating from the so-called Panama Papers in April 2016. 
Gunnlaugsson stood down as Prime Minister and was replaced by Fisheries 
Minister Sigurour Ingi Johannsson. However, opposition parties pressed for 
early elections, and in August 2016, elections were called for October 2016. 

In the election, turnout among eligible voters was 79.2%, and seven parties
won representation in parliament (Althingi). The Progressive Party suffered
significant losses, losing 11 seats and winning only 11.5% of the vote, 
down nearly 13-points on its performance in the 2013 election. As in 2013
(and throughout most of Iceland's democratic history), the Independence 
Party secured the most votes (29.0%), but it was the Pirate Party and the
newly created Reform Party who made most gains. The former won 14.5% of the
vote and increased its seat tally by 7, to become the third-largest party 
in parliament. Reform, consisting of some members who had split from the 
Independence Party, won 7 seats and 10.5%. Meanwhile, the Social Democratic 
Alliance suffered its worst result since 1999, losing six seats and coming 
seventh in vote share. 

Following lengthy coalition negotiations, the Independence Party, the 
Reform Party and Bright Future agreed to form a three-party coalition. On 
January 11, 2017, former Finance Minister and Independence Party leader 
Bjarni Benediktsson became Prime Minister.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - ICELAND (2017)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2017 Icelandic lower house election took place on Saturday, October 28,
2017. The election was the second one within a year, with the incumbent
three-party government comprising the Independence Party, the Reform Party,
and Bright Future, collapsing in September 2017 in scandal. The scandal 
centered on a letter written by Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson's father
recommending a convicted child molester having his "honor restored", a 
mechanism under Icelandic law where certain civil rights can be resorted 
after convicts serve the sentence if three letters of recommendations
attesting the convicts' good character are received. It was discovered that
Prime Minister Benediktsson (Independence Party) had knowledge of the letter
written by his father but failed to tell his coalition partners about the 
letter for two months. Bright Future quit the coalition and new elections 
were called. 

Turnout among eligible voters was 81.2%. The Independence Party lost five
seats, winning 25.2% of the vote and 16 seats, its poorest performance
since 2009, although it remained the largest party in parliament.
After posting a disappointing result in 2016, the Social Democratic Alliance
bounced back, winning 12.1% of the vote and four additional seats, bringing
its tally to 7 seats. The biggest winner was the Center Party which had been
formed in September 2017 after splitting from the Progressive Party. Under
the leadership of former Prime Minister Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson, it won 10.9% 
of the vote, and 7 seats. Bright Future, which had spent just nine months in
government, lost four fifths of its popular support and lost all four of its
seats. Overall, eight parties gained representation in the Icelandic lower
house.

On November 30, 2017, the Left-Green Movement's leader Katrin 
Jakobsdottir successfully negotiated a three-party coalition government 
consisting of her party, the Independence Party, and the Progressive Party. 
Jakobsdottir became Iceland's second female Prime Minister and the first 
Green-Left leader to occupy the office.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - IRELAND (2016)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2016 Irish Parliamentary election took place on Friday, February 26, 
2016. Turnout among registered voters was 65.1%. The election was the first 
since the 2011 "Earthquake" election which saw the dominant party, Fianna 
Fail, suffer a crushing defeat over its handling of the Global Financial 
Crisis (GFC). The election was also the first since the introduction of a 
gender-quota law for candidate selection which permits a party must have at 
least 30% of candidates from each gender or lose half of the state party 
funding for the subsequent parliamentary term. 

The 2016 election resulted in significant losses for the incumbent Fine
Gael/Labor coalition. The outgoing coalition, swept to office with a record
majority in 2011, lost 57 seats. Fine Gael lost 11-points in vote share 
but still managed to secure the most votes (25.5%), but only 50 seats, 
down 26 on its 2011 performance. The Labor Party suffered its worst result
since 1987, losing all but 6 of its seats and its leader and deputy Prime
Minister Joan Burton resigning. Fianna Fail, under the leadership of 
Michael Martin, saw a resurgence, winning 44 seats and 24% of the vote. 
There were also significant gains for the Nationalist Sinn Fein and 
independent candidates. 

The government formation following the election lasted for 63 days as Fine 
Gael struggled to securing a government partner. After three failed attempts
to elect a Taoiseach (Irish PM), Fine Gael finally secured support 
from nine independent candidates and agreed a confidence and supply deal 
with the main opposition party, Fianna Fail. Enda Kenny was re-elected 
Taoiseach on May 6, 2016, the first Fine Gael Prime Minister to secure a 
second successive term since 1927.

<<>> ELECTION SUMMARY - ISRAEL (2020)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2020 Israeli legislative election was held on March 2, 2020 to elect 
the 120 members of the 23rd Knesset. This was the third election in the 
space of 13-months, and followed a period of political deadlock after the 
April and September 2019 contests failed to see a majority government 
formed. Voter turnout in the 2020 election was 71.5%. The election took 
place just before the COVID-19 pandemic was declared a pandemic on March 11, 
2020 (although fieldwork for the 2020 study was conducted during the 
pandemic). 

As with the two contests in 2019, Likud and Blue and White emerged as the
two strongest parties, with very similar levels of support. Likud, led by 
incumbent long-serving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, received the 
most votes, scoring 29.5% and 36 seats. Blue and White, led by Benny Gantz, 
received 26.6% and 33 seats. Coming in third place was the Joint List, a 
political alliance of four Arab-majority parties: Balad, Hadash, Ta'al, and 
the Arab Democratic Party. Together they won 12.7% and 15 seats. 

Prior to the election, Blue and White leader Benny Gantz had vowed he would
not form a government with incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who
was facing corruption charges. However, shortly after the election, the 
COVID-19 pandemic took root, and Gantz changed position and entered into
negotiations on the formation of a national unity government. After lengthy
coalition talks, on May 17, 2020, Benjamin Netanyahu was sworn in as prime
minister of a new coalition government. The coalition arrangement involved
a rotating prime ministership, with Gantz assuming the role of prime 
minister later in the parliamentary term. However, this new coalition was
short-lived with the government failing to get support for its budget, 
and the coalition collapsed on December 23, 2020, prompting fresh elections
in spring 2021.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - ITALY (2018)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2018 Italian general election, involving elections to both the lower 
and upper house, took place on Sunday, March 4, 2018. The elections were
the first held under the new electoral system, approved in late 2017, by 
parliament, which involved both houses being elected using a parallel
voting system. Voters had one vote and could cast their ballot for a party
list only, a district candidate only, or a party list and a district
candidate (split-ticket voting was not allowed). The vote was a fused vote
in that a ballot for a party list would be extended to the party list's
district candidate and a vote for a district candidate would be extended to
the candidate's party. Of the deputies (Lower House), 232 were elected in 
single-member constituencies (plurality), and 386 were elected in multi-
member constituencies by national proportional representation. Also, 12 
deputies were elected in multi-member abroad constituencies. The 315 
senators (Upper House) were elected in 116 single-member constituencies 
(plurality) and 193 were elected in multi-member districts by national 
proportional representation. Additionally, six deputies were elected in 
multi-member abroad constituencies.  

Turnout among registered voters was 72.9%. In the Chamber of Deputies 
(Lower House), the Five Star Movement (M5S) won the most seats, securing 
265 out of the 630 total seats, and achieving 32.7% of the vote, but the
center-right coalition emerged with the most votes and seats when counted 
together. The leading party of this alliance was the League (LN), who won
125 seats, an increase of 109 on the previous election. The incumbent 
Democratic Party (PD), the main party of the center-left coalition, was
decimated, winning 18.8% of the vote and 112 seats, a loss of 180 compared
to its 2013 performance. Meanwhile, in the Upper House, the Five Star 
Movement (M5S) also won the most seats but the center-right coalition 
together had the most votes and seats.  

Nearly three months after the election, on June 1, 2018, the Independent 
Guiseppe Conte was sworn in as Prime Minister, leading a coalition 
between the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League (LN).

<<>> ELECTION SUMMARY - JAPAN (2017)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2017 General elections in Japan took place on Sunday, October 22, 2017.
Voters elected 465 MPs of the Japanese House of Representatives, the lower
house of the bicameral National Diet of Japan. Turnout in the 2017 elections
was 53.7%.

Conventionally, the House of Representatives has a fixed term of four years, 
and elections were not originally scheduled until 2018. However, incumbent
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called a snap poll, arguing he needed a fresh
mandate to deal with the rising tensions, caused by missile launches and 
nuclear testing by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Besides 
the DPRK issue, other issues of prominence in the contest were the planned 
increase in consumption tax, and constitutional amendments focused on 
Article 9 of the Japanese constitution which prohibits war as a means of 
settling international disputes. 

In 2016, the Japanese electoral law changed. It saw the number of 
single-member constituencies decreased from 295 to 289. Additionally, the 
number of seats elected under the proportional segment decreased from 180 to 
176. The eligible voting age also changed in the 2017 contest with eligible
citizens aged 18 and above allowed vote (previously the eligible voting
age had been 20). 

The Liberal Democratic Party, led by Shinzo Abe, and Komeito retained its
two-thirds majority in the 2017 contest, winning a total of 335 seats.  
Shinzo Abe remained in office as Prime Minister, winning his fourth term,
in the process becoming the longest-serving Prime Minister in Japanese 
history.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - MONTENEGRO (2016)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2016 Montenegrin Parliamentary elections were held on Sunday, 
October 16, 2016. 73.4% of registered voters turned out to cast a vote.
The elections were held in the midst of controversy and anti-government 
protests which had taken root in autumn 2015. After corruption allegations 
concerning Montenegro's long-time President and Prime Minister Milo 
Djukanovic, street demonstrations erupted, with serious riots in the capital
Podgorica in October 2015. The main opposition alliance, the Democratic 
Front (DF), called for Djukanovic to resign and the formation of a 
cross-national transitional government to ensure fair elections in 2016. 

In January 2016, the governing coalition between the Democratic Party (DPS)
and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) collapsed after disagreements on the
organization of the 2016 elections. In April 2016, the DPS struck a deal to
form a provisional government with several opposition parties (Positive
Montenegro, DEMOS, and the SDP), although the Democratic Front (DF), the
main opposition, did not participate. 

The dominant DPS, in power since Montenegro's first elections in 1991, won 
the elections, winning 41.4% of the vote and 36 seats, an increase of 3 on 
its 2012 performance. The main opposition, DF, won 20.3% of the vote. 
Positive Montenegro were the big losers, losing all seven seats in 
parliament. Justice Minister Dusko Markovic became Prime Minister on
November 28, 2016, succeeding Djukanovic. The election was overshadowed by
a coup d'etat plot on election day, when several people, including two 
Russian nationals, were arrested and later charged in relation to the 
incident. The issue led to opposition parties declaring a collective 
boycott of parliament and the main opposition party later refusing to 
participate in local elections.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - NETHERLANDS (2017)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2017 Dutch general election was held on Wednesday, March 15, 2017, to 
elect all 150 members of the lower house. Turnout among registered voters 
was 81.9%. Incumbent Prime minister Mark Rutte's coalition comprising his
People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and Labor (PvdA) were the
first government to serve a full-term since the Purple coalition in 2002. 

Despite topping the poll winning 21.3% of the vote and 33 seats, the VVD 
lost eight seats and it's vote contracted by nearly 5-points. Outgoing
coalition partners Labor (PvdA) suffered its worst election result ever, 
winning only 5.7% of the vote and nine seats, falling to seventh place in
the popular vote share, and losing 29 seats compared to its 2012 
performance. 
The big winners in the contest where the GroenLinks, who gained ten seats, 
and won 9.1% of the vote, their best ever performance. There were also gains
for Geert Wilders' right-wing populist Party for Freedom (PVV), who came
second in the popular vote, winning 13.1%, and 20 seats, an increase of 5.
And D66 scored their best performance in 20-years, winning 12.2% of the vote
and 19 seats. 

After failed negotiations between VVD, CDA, D66 and GroenLinks in May 2017, 
VVD, CDA, and D66, after protracted negotiations, agreed to form a coalition 
with the Christian Union (CU) on October 9, 2017. The new coalition just 
reaching the required 76-seat-majority in the lower house. The new 
government granted Mark Rutte a third consecutive term as Prime Minister. He

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - NEW ZEALAND (2017)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2017 New Zealand Parliamentary election was held on Saturday, September 
23, 2017. The turnout among registered voters was 78.9%.

The results of the general election were surprising and far-reaching. 
Opinion polls had anticipated a repeat of the 2014 election with the 
National Party expected to win a fourth term in office and the leading
opposition party Labor lagging. When the votes were counted, the National
Party won the most votes and seats but fell short of an overall majority 
with 56 seats, losing four seats overall. Labor surpassed expectations, 
winning 36.9% of the vote and 46 seats (29 electorate wins and 17 list 
seats), an increase of 14 seats on 2014, meaning a Labor-led minority 
administration was viable. 

NZ First won the third most votes - 7.2% and formed a minority coalition
with Labor, facilitated by a confidence and supply agreement with the 
Green Party. Jacinta Ardern became Prime Minister, New Zealand's third 
female head of government with NZ First leader Winston Peters as her Deputy 
and Minister for Foreign Affairs. At the same time, outgoing Prime Minister 
Bill English resigned as leader of the Nationals, having served as Prime 
Minister for ten months.

<<>> ELECTION SUMMARY - NEW ZEALAND (2020)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2020 New Zealand Parliamentary election was held on Saturday, October 
17, 2020. The election took place during the COVID-19 pandemic and was 
delayed by one month after a community transmission outbreak in the North 
Island city of Auckland. 

The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound effect on daily lives. Polls early in 
2020 suggested a close election between the incumbent Labor-led coalition 
and the main opposition National Party. But with the onset of the pandemic, 
support for the Labor Party increased, with incumbent Prime Minister 
Jacinda Ardern earning credit for the government's firm response to the 
crisis. Meanwhile, the opposition Nationals were beset by leadership 
struggles, with two changes in 2020, after first Simon Bridges and then 
Todd Muller were forced to quit the leadership, with Judith Collins 
eventually emerging as chief.

The turnout among registered voters was 82.2%, increasing nearly three 
points from the previous election in 2017. The election resulted in a 
landslide victory for Labor, who won 45% of the popular vote and 65 seats, 
forming the first Labor single-party majority government since 1946, and 
the first one-party administration since the adoption of the Mixed Member 
Proportional (MMP) voting system in 1996. The other big winners were the 
ACT party, who gained nine seats on their 2017 performance, and won 7.6% of 
the popular vote. The Nationals scored their second-worst result in their 
history, winning 34% of the popular vote, down 9-points on the 2017 score, 
and only 33 seats. The populist-nationalist party New Zealand First, part of 
the incumbent coalition with Labor, had its worst result ever, failing to 
cross the electoral threshold and losing all its seats.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - NORWAY (2017)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2017 Norwegian Parliamentary election took place on Monday, September 
11, 2017. Turnout among registered voters was 78.3%. Although the Labor 
Party (Ap), led by former Foreign Minister Jonas Gahre Store, won the most 
votes and seats in the Storting (Norwegian Parliament), the party lost six 
seats, achieving its worst result since 2001 and its second-worst result 
since 1924.

The non-left parties retained their majority in parliament. Despite losing 
three seats, the Conservatives (H) remained the largest party of this bloc,
winning 25% of the vote and 45 seats. The Center Party (Sp) advanced, 
winning 10.3% of the vote, up nearly five points on its 2013 performance,
and netting an additional nine seats. The Progress Party (FrP), part of 
the outgoing coalition with the Conservatives, held their own, winning 
15.1% of the vote, coming in third place nationally, with 27 seats. 

On January 14, 2018, the Conservative Party (H), the Progress Party (FrP),
and the Liberal Party (V) agreed to form a minority coalition with Erna 
Solberg, Prime Minister since 2013, remaining Premier. The Christian 
Democrats (KrP) later voted to join the coalition, marking the first 
time since 1985 that Norway's right bloc had formed a majority government.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - PORTUGAL (2019)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2019 Portuguese lower house election took place on Sunday, October 6,
2019. All 230 seats of the Assembly of the Republic, Portugal's unicameral 
legislature, were at stake. The turnout rate among registered voters was
48.6%, a historic low for lower house elections. Incumbent Prime Minister
Antonio Costa (Socialist Party, SP) contested for re-election. Before the 
election, Costa headed a minority government and relied on external support
from the Left Bloc (BE), the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) and the 
Greens (PEV). 

Costa's governing Socialist Party surpassed the Social Democratic Party 
(PPD/PSD) to become the strongest party, winning 36.4% of the vote and 
108 seats, a plus of 22 seats. In second, the Social Democrats suffered a
significant defeat by securing 79 seats (27.8%), thereby losing ten seats.
While the Left Bloc retained its position as the third-largest party 
(9.52%, 19 seats), the Unitary Democratic Coalition (Communists and Greens)
lost five of the previously held 17 seats with a vote share of 6.3%
(12 seats). However, the worst defeat was experienced by the People's Party
(CDS-PP), which came fifth with a vote share of 4.2% (5 seats), losing 
almost three-quarters of their representatives in parliament. 
The 2019 election also resulted in three new parties gaining representation
in parliament with one seat each: Enough (CH), Liberal Initiative (IL) 
and Free (L).

Short of a majority in parliament, Antonio Costa (SP) formed a single-party
minority government without any formal cooperation agreements, after turning
down a proposal from the Left Bloc. Costa officially resumed office as
prime minister on October 26, 2019.

<<>> ELECTION SUMMARY - SLOVAKIA (2020)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2020 general election in Slovakia took place on Saturday, February 29,
2020 to elect 150 members of the Slovak National Council, the country's 
unicameral parliament. Turnout in 2020 elections was 65.8% of registered
voters, up six-points on the 2016 contest. The election took place just 
before the COVID-19 pandemic was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020 
(although fieldwork for the 2020 study was conducted during the pandemic). 

The Ordinary People and Independent Personalities (OLANO) movement won
most seats, winning 53, and 25% of the vote, a gain of 34-seats on its 2016
performance. For the People, a centrist party was a new entrant to 
parliament, winning 12 seats, and We are Family, won 16 seats, an increase
of six, and 8.24% of the vote. Meanwhile, for the outgoing coalition led by
Direction - Social Democracy (Smer-SD), it lost a substantial swathe of 
support. Direction - Social Democracy (Smer-SD) lost 11 seats, and 10-points
off its vote share, winning only 38 seats and 18.3% of the vote, its 
worst performance since 2002, and the first time since 2006 that they had
failed to top the poll. For coalition partners the Slovak National Party
(SNS), the party lost all its seats, winning only 3.2% of the vote, and 
failing to enter parliament. 

On March 13, Igor Matovic, leader of the OLANO movement, announced his party 
had reached a coalition agreement with We Are Family, Freedom and 
Solidarity, and For the People. Matovic became Prime Minister of March 21, 
2020.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - SOUTH KOREA (2016)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2016 South Korean lower house election was held on Wednesday, April 
13, 2016. 58.15% of registered voters turned out to vote.
Less than two months ahead of the election and after several rounds of 
failed negotiations, the governing Saenuri Party and the major opposition 
party, the Democratic Party, agreed to an electoral district reform, as 
demanded by a ruling of South Korea's Constitutional Court. Due to the late 
agreement, registered candidates were allowed to start campaigning for the 
2016 election even without predefined electoral districts. Compared to the 
previous legislative election in 2012, the number of single-member 
constituencies increased from 246 to 253, while the number of seats 
returned by proportional representation decreased from 54 to 47. 
Further, the 2016 election was the first major legislative election after 
the dissolution of the Unified Progressive Party (UPP) in 2014 and the 
formation of the People's Party in December 2015.

Surprisingly to many observers, the Saenuri Party led by Kim Moo-sung lost 
its majority in the National Assembly, by securing only 122 out of 300 
seats. Additionally, for the first time since 2000, the Saenuri Party lost
its plurality of seats to the Democratic Party led by Kim Chong-in, which 
obtained 123 seats and thus one more seat than the Saenuri Party. 
Ahn Cheol-soo's People's Party entered parliament for the first time by 
securing 38 seats. As a response to electoral defeat, party leaders of the 
Saenuri party resigned.

<<>> ELECTION SUMMARY - SWEDEN (2018)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2018 Swedish lower house election took place on Sunday, September 9, 
2018. The turnout rate among registered voters was 87.18%. Although the 
Social Democratic Party (SAP) of incumbent prime minister Stefan Lofven 
defended its traditional position as the strongest party, it received its 
lowest vote share for over a century (28.26%, 100 seats). Likewise, the 
SAP's coalition partner, the Greens (MP), only came in seventh with 4.41% 
and 16 seats, thereby losing more than one-third of its seats in the 
Riksdag, barely surpassing the 4% electoral threshold. The Left Party (V), 
that supported the previous red-green minority government was the only 
member of the left bloc improving its previous election result by gaining 
8% of the vote (28 seats). 

The biggest member of the center-right Alliance, the Moderate Party (M), 
came in second with 19.84% of the vote but experienced a significant defeat
by losing 14 seats (retaining 70 seats). The three smaller Alliance members,
the Center Party (8.61%), the Christian Democrats (6.32%) and the Liberals
(5.49%) all gained in votes and seats compared to 2014. Finally, the Sweden
Democrats (SD), a radical party, reinforced its position as Sweden's third-
biggest party by gaining 17.53% of the vote and 62 seats. 

The SD's electoral performance left Sweden with a hung parliament, with both
major blocs falling short of a parliamentary majority. On September 25, 
2018, the incumbent prime minister Lofven lost a vote of confidence in the 
Riksdag. After several failed attempts at forming a new government, Lofven 
was finally re-elected prime minister on January 18, 2019. However, 
controlling only 115 votes in parliament, Lofven fell well short of a 
parliamentary majority (175 seats). His coalition government with the 
Greens was enabled by the principle of negative parliamentarism, requiring a
majority against the government for an investiture vote to fail. Hence, 
the 77 abstentions by the Left Party, Center Party and Liberal Party proved
decisive for Lofven's re-election.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2019 Federal elections in Switzerland were held on Sunday, October 20,
2019. Swiss voters elected all members of both houses of the Federal
Assembly. Turnout was 45.1%, three percentage points lower than in the 2015
elections. The Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC) remained the largest party in
the National Council with 25.6% of the vote and 53 seats, down from 65 in 
2015. Two green parties gained the most seats in the contest: the Green
Party won 28 seats, 17 more than in 2015, while Green Liberal Party
gained nine seats more than before, winning 16 seats in 2019. All of this
prompted media to describe 2019 Swiss Federal election results as a
"green wave." However, these gains had less of an impact on the coalition-
government formation process, as the Swiss government operates on a 
consensus-seeking model and is composed of representatives of the four 
largest parties.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - TAIWAN (2016)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

General elections in Taiwan were held on Saturday, January 16, 2016. Voters 
were electing the 14th President of Taiwan and 113 members of Taiwan 
Legislative body - Yuan. The turnout for Presidential elections was 66.3%. 
Going into the election, The Kuomintang of China, one of the major parties 
in Taiwan, held both the presidency and majority in parliament. 

However, the 2016 elections saw a complete change, as the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Tsai Ing-wen won 56.1% of
votes and became the new president of Taiwan, and first women elected into
the office. The DPP also won a majority in the Parliamentary elections. 
One of the surprises of the 2016 elections was the result of the New Power
Party (NPP). Only one year after the party was formed, it became the third
largest party in Taiwan, winning five seats in the legislature.

<<>> ELECTION SUMMARY - TAIWAN (2020)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 15th presidential and the 10th legislative elections in Taiwan took 
place on Saturday, January 11, 2020. The turnout among registered voters was
75.1%, nine percentage points higher than in the previous election in 2016.
The election took place just before the COVID-19 pandemic took root 
(although fieldwork for the 2020 study was in part conducted during the 
pandemic). 

For decades, the relationship between Taiwan and China has been an important 
policy issue, and the issue featured heavily during the election campaign. 
After the 2018 midterms, popular opinion foreshadowed that the Kuomintang 
Party (KMT) with its pro-China policies would perform strongly in the next 
general election. However, after protests in Hong Kong against Chinese 
interference and supposed abandonment of the One Country Two Systems Policy,
many Taiwanese expressed concern about closer ties with China. This resulted
in the incumbent president Tsai Ing-wen, of the Progressive Democratic 
People's Party (DPP), having a decisive victory over Han Kuo-yu and the KMT,
and the third-party candidate James Soong. Tsai Ing-wen gained about 57% of 
the popular vote whilst Han Kuo-yu solely gained 39% and James Soong 4%. 

The DPP was also successful at winning seats in Taiwan's legislature, the 
Yuan. In 2016, the DPP won for the first time a comfortable majority over 
the KMT. In 2020, they could maintain this majority by reaching 61 seats 
and thus losing 7 seats of their previous 68 seats. The in 2019 newly 
established Taiwan People's Party (TPP) received more than 5% of the 
popular vote in the party-list proportional representation, winning 5 seats
in the legislature and more important the ability to directly nominate its
own presidential candidate in the 2024 Taiwan presidential election. The
People First Party (PFP) did not win any seats in the 2020 election.
Because the party did not pass the 5% hurdle in the proportional 
representation, the party will not be able to directly nominate a 
presidential candidate in the next Taiwanese presidential election.

<<>> ELECTION SUMMARY - THAILAND (2019)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Thai 2019 general election was held on Sunday, March 24, 2019, to elect 
all 500 members of the House of Representatives, Thailand's lower house. 
Turnout among registered voters was 74.9%.

The 2019 elections were the first held in the country since the coup d'etat
in May 2014, headed by Prayut Chan-o-cha, the Commander-in-Chief of the 
Royal Thai Army. Following the dismissal from office of Prime Minister 
Yingluck Shinawatra (Pheu Thai Party, PTP) by the Constitutional Court, the
military seized power and established the National Council for Peace and 
Order (NCPO) as the nation's military governing body. Since the outset of 
the junta government, Prayut acted as the leader of the NCPO and new Prime
Minister.

After several delays, the election date was finally set in early 2019. 
Prayut Chan-o-cha contested the election as incumbent Prime Minister and 
leader of the newly founded State Power Party (PPRP). Elections were held 
under the new 2017 constitution, introducing changes to the electoral 
system. For the 2019 election, 350 of the 500 parliamentary seats were 
elected by plurality vote in single-member constituencies, with the 
remaining 150 seats being elected through closed-list proportional 
representation. Voters cast a single fused vote counting towards both 
segments. Further, the constitution specified that the new Prime Minister 
was to be elected by the full parliament, i.e., by joint members of the 
House of Representatives and the Senate, consisting of 250 members appointed
by the military. Hence, candidates were required to win 376 out of 750 votes
from the combined houses to win prime ministership.

In adapting to the newly introduced rules that were perceived as 
disadvantaging opposition parties, the Pheu Thai party led by Sudarat 
Keyuraphan decided to coordinate campaigns with the affiliated Thai Raksa 
Chart Party (TRC) to compete against Prayut's PPRP. To increase the chances
of winning party-list seats, Pheu Thai ceded candidacies in 100 
constituencies to TRC, with prominent members of PTP competing on TRC 
tickets. The TRC nominated Thai Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya, the King's
sister, as their candidate for prime minister. At the beginning of March, 
TRC was dissolved by the Constitutional Court for allowing a Royal Family
member to enter politics, following a condemnation of the Princess's 
candidacy by the King. 

Prayut Chan-o-cha's State Power Party came out as the strongest party in the
election, obtaining a vote share of 23.7% and 116 seats. Although Pheu Thai 
came only second with 22.2%, it became the strongest group in the lower 
house by winning 136 district candidate seats. The newly founded Future 
Forward Party (FFP), also campaigning on an anti-junta stance, came in third
with 17.8% of the vote, thereby gaining 81 seats. The conservative Democrat
Party (DP), the oldest party in Thailand, became the fourth-strongest party
with 11.1% and 53 seats, a disappointing outcome for the party leading to 
the resignation of its chairman and former Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva.

In the aftermath of the election, Thailand's Electoral Commission, the 
country's electoral management body, was criticized for announcing official
results only weeks after the election. The constitution provided no strict
guidance for allocating party-list seats, hence granting the EC some leeway
in calculating seat shares. Eventually, the EC decided to reduce the minimum
threshold for a parliamentary seat from approximately 71,000 votes as 
announced initially to around 35,000 votes, thereby increasing the number of
parties represented in parliament to 26 at the expense of anti-junta 
coalition parties. 

Forging a coalition of 19 political parties, Prayut Chan-o-cha was 
re-elected as Prime Minister on June 5, 2019, also supported by all members
of the Senate.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2019 Tunisian parliamentary election took place on Sunday, October 6, 
2019. The first round of the 2019 presidential election was held on 
September 15, 2019, and the second round on October 13, 2019. The turnout in 
both elections was considerably lower than in the previous elections, where 
turnout was higher than 60%. In the parliamentary election, 41.7% of the 
population eligible to vote turned out to vote. In the presidential 
elections, 49% of the electorate participated in the first round and 55% in 
the second round.  

In the parliamentary election, the second since the 2011 revolution, the 
Ennahda Movement gained the most votes (20%) and seats (52), although it 
lost 17 seats on its 2014 performance. The Heart of Tunisia party came 
second, winning 15% of the vote and 38 seats. The Free Destourian Party, 
founded by former members of Tunisia's pre-revolution ruling party, the 
Constitutional Democratic Rally, came third in the popular vote, winning 
6.6% of the vote, and 17-seats. The other big winners of the election were 
the People's Movement, a secularist socialist party, who won 4.5% of the 
vote and 15 seats, an increase of 12 on the 2014 contest. No party or 
alliance obtained a majority, leading to months of negotiations. A new 
coalition government consisted of the Ennahda Movement, Tahya Tounes, 
the People's Movement, Democratic Current, the Tunisian Alternative and 
several independent party lists was formed in February 2020. 

In the presidential election, the second direct vote since the 2011 
revolution, the contest was brought forward after the death of incumbent 
President Beji Caid Essebsi. Twenty-seven candidates contested the first 
round but no candidate received a majority, leading to a runoff between 
the two leading candidates, Kais Saied, a social conservative, and 
independent supported by the Ennahda Movement; and Nabil Karoui, affiliated 
with the Heart of Tunisia. Whilst, Kais Saied won only 18% 
support in the first round, he gained a substantial majority of the vote 
(73%) in Round 2, defeating opponent Nabil Karoui, who won 27% of the vote.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - TURKEY (2018)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2018 Turkish General Elections took place on Sunday, June 24, 2018. 
Turkish citizens elected both the Grand National Assembly, Turkey's 
unicameral parliament, and the President. Elections were initially scheduled
for November 2019 but were held early following an agreement between the 
ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the Nationalist Movement 
Party (MHP) in April 2018. Further, elections took place under an ongoing 
state of emergency, which was declared after a failed coup d'etat against
the government on July 15, 2016.

The 2018 elections also marked a turn in Turkey's political system, as the
new Presidential system, which was adopted by a referendum in April 2017, 
fully came into effect after the election. The 2017 referendum approved 
major constitutional changes, such as the abolition of the office of the 
Prime Minister, the strengthening of executive powers of the President, and
the reduction of parliamentary oversight. Additionally, constitutional 
amendments increased the number of members of parliament from 550 to 600,
resulting in two additional electoral districts (87 in total) and many 
districts gaining additional seats.
  
86.2% of registered voters turned out to vote in the Presidential election.
Also supported by the MHP, incumbent President and party leader Recep Tayyip
Erdogan (AKP) won the election with 52.59% of the vote in the first round. 
Following the constitutional amendments adopted by the referendum in 2017, 
Erdogan became both the head of state and the head of government. 

For the Parliamentary election, the turnout rate among registered voters 
was 86.22%. The governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) emerged as  
the most successful party but lost its absolute majority in parliament, 
achieving 42.56% of the vote (295 seats). Together with the MHP (11.1%, 49
seats) the AKP formed the "People's Alliance" for the election. 
The opposition parties Republican People's Party (CHP), Good Party (IYI), 
and Felicity Party (SP) formed the "Nation Alliance", which together won 
33.94% of the vote and 189 seats. The People's Democratic Party (HDP) came
in third by winning 11.7% of the vote (49 seats).

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - UNITED STATES (2016)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2016 United States general election were held on Tuesday, November 8, 
2016. Voters elected the President, all 435 members of the Lower House 
(House of Representatives) and 34 out of 100 members of the Upper House 
(Senate), as well as many state offices. 

Incumbent President Barack Obama (Democrat), in office since 2009, was 
ineligible for re-election because of term limits. Contesting the election 
for the Presidency were former Secretary of State and First Lady of the 
United States Hillary Clinton, nominated by the Democratic Party, and 
businessman and television personality Donald Trump for the Republican 
Party. 

The election campaign was marred by controversy over Hillary Clinton's use 
of a private e-mail server during her time as Secretary of State and 
Donald Trump's fitness for office after a series of controversial 
statements and behaviors were exposed. 
Turnout among registered voters was 63.8%. Although Clinton won the popular
vote, obtaining 48.2% to Donald Trump's 46.1%, Trump won the electoral 
college, winning 304 to 228 electoral votes. He assumed office on 
January 20, 2017. 

Meanwhile, in the House of Representatives, the Republicans maintained 
their control, securing 241 seats, while the Democrats won 194. In the 
Senate, the Republicans won 22 of the 34 races, resulting in them holding 
52 seats, and a majority in the Senate. It was the first time since 2004 
that Republicans controlled the Presidency, the House, and the Senate 
simultaneously.

<<>> ELECTION SUMMARY - UNITED STATES (2020)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
The 2020 United States general election was held on Tuesday, November 3,
2020. The elections took place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Voters elected
the President, all 435 members of the Lower House (House of Representatives)
and 35 out of 100 members of the Upper House (Senate). In the Presidential
race, incumbent Republican Donald Trump sought a second term and faced
little opposition in winning his party's nomination. In the election, he 
faced Democratic challenger, former Vice President, Joe Biden.
 
Before the pandemic took root, the Democratic-controlled House of
Representatives voted to impeach President Trump for obstruction of justice
and abuse of power in December 2019. The charges related to apparent
attempts by President Trump to induce foreign interference in the 2020
elections. The Senate acquitted the President of the charges in February
2020, largely on a party line vote.
 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many U.S. States introduced the option
(or made it easier) to vote early or by mail. However, this was
controversial, with President Donald Trump casting doubt on the integrity
of mail-in ballots.
 
In the election, turnout among registered voters was 69.5%. Democrat Joe
Biden and his vice presidential running mate Kamala Harris won the election.
They won the popular vote by 51% to 47% and the all-important electoral
college vote by 306 to 232. President Trump refused to acknowledge the 
result, sparking protests by Trump supporters nationwide, and legal 
challenges concerning the counts in several states, none of which succeeded
in changing the election outcome.
 
Protests culminated on January 6, 2021, in a rally held and addressed by
President Trump in Washington, D.C., to coincide with the U.S. Congress'
certification of the election results. After the President's speech, some
attendees at the President's rally marched on the U.S. Capitol building,
breaking through law enforcement, occupying the building. The sittings of
both chambers were suspended as politicians and staff were evacuated from
the building. After several hours of a standoff, law enforcement regained
control and ejected protestors from the Capitol. Congress resumed shortly
after and certified the election result. Five people died during the
January 6 protests and the new Congress impeached President Trump for a 
second time for his actions relating to the events. Joe Biden and Kamala 
Harris took office as President and Vice President on January 20, 2021.
 
Elsewhere, the Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives,
although the Republicans gained seats in the election. Control of the U.S.
Senate was not decided until January 2021, when the Democrats won two
run-off contests in Georgia. With the support of two Independents who
caucus with the party, the Democrats gained control of the Senate on the
tie-breaking vote of the United States Vice President, Kamala Harris.

<<>> ELECTION SUMMARY - URUGUAY (2019)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2019 Uruguayan general election took place on Sunday, October 27, 
2019 to elect the President and the General Assembly. As none of the 
presidential candidates received a majority in the first round, a runoff 
was held on Sunday, November 24, 2019. The turnout in both elections was 
90.1%, where voting is compulsory. 
The elections were held using the Joint Vote Method (also known as Double, 
Simultaneous Vote) whereby voters cast a single vote for their favorite 
party that counts for all elected institutions: The Presidency, the Chamber
of Representatives, and the Senate. 
 
The presidential elections marked the first defeat of the Broad Front in a 
presidential election since 1999. At the same time, Luis Alberto Lacalle 
Pou became the first National Party president since 1995. In the first 
round, the Broad Front, led by Daniel Martinez, experienced its worst 
election results since 1999 but still qualified for the runoff along with 
Lacalle Pou from the National Party. In a very tight race, the second round 
results disclosed Lacalle Pou as the winner with 48.88% of the votes, 
leaving Daniel Martinez, leading with 10% in the first round, with 47.36% 
of the votes. 
 
In the election of the General Assembly, the Broad Front gained most of the 
popular vote with about 39% leading to 42 seats in the Chamber and 13 seats 
in the Senate. The National Party won the second-highest number of votes 
with about 29% resulting in 30 seats in the Chamber and ten seats in the 
Senate. The Colorado Party, led by Ernesto Talvi, won 12.3% of the votes, 
13 seats in the Chamber and four seats in the Senate. The newly formed 
party Open Cabildo earned 11%, 11 seats in the Chamber and four seats in 
the Senate. The Partido Ecologista Radical Intransigente, Party of the Folk 
and Independent Party won one seat in the Chamber but no seat in the 
Senate. The remaining four parties Popular Unity, Green Animalist Party, 
Digital Party and Worker's Party did not receive enough votes to gain a 
seat in the Chamber or the Senate.
