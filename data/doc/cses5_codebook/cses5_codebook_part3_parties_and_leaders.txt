))) IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING ADVANCE RELEASES
===========================================================================

This dataset and all accompanying documentation is the "Fourth Advance 
Release" of CSES Module 5 (2016-2021).

By definition, an Advance Release is a preliminary version of a dataset,
and thus lacks some of the checking, cleaning, processing, documentation,
data, and variables that are usual to the Full Release of a dataset. Many
election studies that will eventually be present in the CSES Module 5 Full
Release are not available in this file.

Advance Releases are provided as a service to the CSES user community,
for those analysts who find it valuable to work with preliminary versions
of the dataset. We would appreciate being notified of any errors in the
dataset or documentation by email to "cses@umich.edu".

Users should expect future changes and improvements to the naming, data,
and documentation of variables and election studies that appear in an
Advance Release file. If users wish to re-use their programming code on
a future release of the file, the code should be written in a way that is
flexible and can be accommodating of these future changes.

Users of the Advance Release may also wish to monitor the errata for 
CSES Module 5 on the CSES website, to check for known errors which 
may impact their analyses. To view errata for CSES Module 5, go to Data
Download on the CSES website, navigate to the CSES Module 5 download page, 
and click on the Errata link in the white box to the right of the page.

We hope that until such time as the Full Release of CSES Module 5 is
available, users will find this and future CSES Module 5 Advance Releases
to be helpful in their work.

===========================================================================
))) OVERVIEW OF "CODEBOOK PART 3: PARTIES AND LEADERS"
===========================================================================

Part 3 of the CSES Codebook identifies the parties/coalitions participating 
during a polity's national election and/or those participating in the 
polity's previous national election. It also details the leaders of 
parties/coalitions and/or presidential candidates (where applicable) 
for the most important parties/coalitions.
Part 3 also lists the party identifiers in other comparative projects, 
namely the Manifesto Research on Political Representation (MARPOR, formerly
the Comparative Manifesto Project) and the Parliament and Government 
(ParlGov) database. This will allow easy data bridging between CSES and 
these other projects. 


===========================================================================
))) HOW TO NAVIGATE THE CSES MODULE 5 CODEBOOK
===========================================================================

In the CSES Module 5 dataset, all variables begin with the letter "E" 
(E being the fifth letter of the English alphabet and thus signifying 
Module 5).

The CSES codebook is especially extensive and users are advised that the 
best way to navigate it is electronically. It is a .txt format which 
allows it to be accessed via a variety of programs. 

The CSES Codebook can be navigated quickly in the electronic files, with 
the following commands allowing for quick searching:

))) = Section Header 

>>> = Sub-section Header 1

<<>> = Sub-section Header 2 

+++ = Tables

VARIABLES NOTES = Notes for particular variables 

ELECTION STUDY NOTES = Notes for a particular election study  

DERIVATIVE VARIABLE = Highlights a variable derived from another 
variable or variables within the CSES.

POTENTIAL POLITY LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging at polity level.

POTENTIAL REGIONAL LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging at regional level.

POTENTIAL TIME BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging by time.

POTENTIAL PARTY/COALITION LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable 
that may be used for data bridging at party/coalition level.

POTENTIAL CSES PRODUCT BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable 
that may be used for data bridging with other CSES products.

For further details on the CSES Module 5 documentation, users are advised
to consult Part 1 of the CSES Codebook. 

  
===========================================================================
))) CSES MODULE 5 CODING OF PARTIES/COALITIONS & LEADERS
===========================================================================

CSES codes parties/coalitions in its dataset numerically and
alphabetically. Below we provide explanations of both of these coding
schemes. The details of each party/leader classification are available in  
Part 3 of the codebook. 

<<>> CSES NUMERICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING

Each party is assigned a unique numerical code which consists of two 
components and six digits in total:
    - the first three digits indicate the numerical country UN code
    - the latter three digits indicate the numerical party code within
      the given election study.

All parties/coalitions or presidential candidates, where applicable,
participating in the election or the previous election receive a numerical
code. These codes are used to identify the following: 
    - who respondents feel best represented by (variable E3010_2).
    - who a respondent voted for in the current election 
      (variable E3013).
    - who the respondent voted for in the previous election 
      (variable E3015).
    - the respondent's party identification (variable E3024).
      
The numeric coding is also used to identify macro level information about
the parties/coalitions, namely: 
    - numeric party code identifiers for Parties A-I (E5000)
    - which party/coalition held the presidency before and after the
      elections (variable E5009 and E5013).
    - which party/coalition held the prime ministership before and after
      the elections (variable E5010 and E5014).
     
Numerical codes assigned to parties/coalitions are consistent for the 
current and previous election.  

<<>> CSES ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING
 
Parties A through F are the six most popular parties/coalitions, ordered in
descending order of their share of the popular vote in the parliamentary 
election (unless otherwise stated). Thus Party A is the party/coalition
that received the most votes in the election, party B the second most
votes, etc...

Parties/coalitions who achieve at least 1% of the vote nationally are
eligible for an alphabetical A-F assignment. In countries with multiple
electoral tiers and where one vote is cast, parties are ordered according
to their vote share in tier 1 (the lowest tier), unless otherwise stated.
In countries where voters have two votes (i.e.: a constituency and a list
vote) simultaneously, for example Germany, parties are ordered by the
national share of the party list vote (tier 2) unless stated otherwise.

Parties G, H, and I are supplemental parties. They may, but do not have to,
accord with how parties A-F are ordered, that is ordered on the popular 
share of the vote in a country. More often, they are codified in no 
particular order. These parties are voluntarily provided by each country's
election study and often reflect important or notable parties within a 
country. They may also include data about individual parties within a 
coalition, where data about the coalition and the individual parties, 
or some of these parties that make it up, are provided.
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro component of 
the CSES dataset: 
    - Respondent's likeability of the party/coalition (variable E3017).
    - Respondent's left-right placement of the party/coalition (variable 
      E3019).

These alphabetical codes are used to identify district and macro level
information about these said parties/coalitions, namely:
    - The said party/coalition's vote share in the respondent's electoral
      district (variable E4004).
    - the said party/coalition's share of the seats in the election in the
      respondent's electoral district (variable E4005)
    - the said party/coalition's share of the vote in the election 
      (variable E5001, E5003, and E5005).
    - the said party/coalition's share of the seats in the election 
      (variable E5002 and E5004).
    - the said party/coalition's share of cabinet portfolios before and 
      after the election (variable E5011 and E5015).
    - expert judgments by the national collaborators of the said party/
      coalition's ideological family (variable E5017).
    - expert judgments by the national collaborators of the said party/
      coalition's left-right placement (variable E5018).
    - expert judgments by the national collaborators of the said party/
      coalition's level of populism (variable E5020).
    - The said party/coalition's Manifesto Research on Political 
      Representation (MARPOR/CMP) Identifier (variable E5200).
    - The said party/coalition's Parliaments and Government Database
      (ParlGov) Identifier (variable E5201).
    - The said party/coalition's Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES) 
      Identifier (variable E5202).
    - The said party/coalition's Party Facts Identifier (variable E5203).
 
<<>> CSES ALPHABETICAL LEADER CODING
         
Leaders A through F tend to be the leaders of the six most popular parties/
coalitions or the presidential candidates of these parties. They correspond
to parties A-F (i.e.: Leader A will be related to Party A in some way,
Leader B will be related to Party B, etc.).

Leaders G, H, and I are supplemental leaders. They may be related to
parties G, H, I but they do not have to be. These leaders are voluntarily
provided by each country's election study and often include data about
additional personalities of interest. For example, in a parliamentary
system, data about a President might be provided, even if the Presidency
is not being contested. On many occasions, slots Leader G, H, and I will
include additional data for parties/coalitions that have multiple leaders.
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro and macro
components of the CSES dataset: 
    - Respondent's likeability of the leader/personality in question
      (variable E3018).


===========================================================================
))) PARTIES AND LEADER CLASSIFICATIONS FOR CSES MODULE 5 BY POLITY & 
    ELECTION YEAR
===========================================================================

All parties/coalitions or presidential candidates, where applicable, 
participating in the election or the previous election receive a 
numerical code. Alphabetical codes are assigned to select parties and 
leaders (see above description on how parties/coalitions and leaders are
coded by the CSES). 

The party/coalition and leaders are listed in numerical order. CSES 
provides the name of the party/coalition in the original language, the 
English version of the party/coalition name, and the party abbreviation, 
where available. Leaders are only listed for parties where we have 
accompanying leader likeability data available. Polities are listed in 
alphabetical order. The party/coalition and leaders are listed in numerical 
order. 

Users are advised to pay particular attention to ELECTION STUDY NOTES 
listed below each polity's party and leader list for additional information
regarding data availability and deviations.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CHILE (2017): PARTIES AND LEADERS
         |
         | LEADERS A-I were the Presidential candidates of their
         | respective parties/alliances in the 2017 Chilean Presidential
         | Election.
         | 
         | The alphabetical codes for political parties were assigned in
         | descending order of the party vote share in Lower House 
         | Election. Some candidates were assigned alphabetical codes
         | because of their results and because there is relational data, 
         | such as the LIKE-DISLIKE or LEADER rating, available for them in
         | the CSES data. They ran as candidates of parties that were not
         | assigned alphabetical codes. Hence there are some instances 
         | where the alphabetical codes for leaders do not match party 
         | codes. This applies to leaders E, G, H, and I.
         |
         | Even though voters in Chile cast votes for candidates in an open
         | list proportional system, alliances play an important role in 
         | the work of parliament and government formation. Some 
         | respondents reported voting for an electoral alliance or for an 
         | independent candidate affiliated with the electoral coalition.
         | These respondents are coded as voting for the coalition, and 
         | that is the reason why coalitions are assigned a separate code.
         | Below, all alliances in Chile are listed, with parties
         | constituting them.
         |
         | 152030. Chile Vamos is an electoral alliance formed by
         | Independent Democratic Union (UDI), Independent Regionalist
         | Party (PRI), National Renewal (RN), and Political Evolution
         | (Evopoli).
         |
         | 152031. The Force of the Majority is an electoral alliance
         | formed by Communist Party (PC), Party for Democracy (PPD),
         | Social Democrat Radical Party (PRSD) and Socialist Party (PS).
         |
         | 152032. Broad Front is an electoral alliance formed by
         | Democratic Revolution (RD), Equality Party (PI), Green Ecologist
         | Party (PEV), Humanist Party (PH), Liberal Party (PL) and Power.
         |
         | 152033. Democratic Convergence is an electoral alliance formed
         | by Christian Democratic Party (PDC), Citizen Left (IC) and
         | MAS Region.
         |
         | 152034. All Over Chile is an electoral alliance formed by Pais
         | and Progressive Party (PRO).
         |
         | 152035. Green Regionalist Coalition is an electoral alliance
         | formed by Patagonian Regional Democracy (DRP) and Social Green
         | Regionalist Federation (FREVS).

         | Citizens and Everybody.
         |

         | The Finns Party (numerical code 246002) split in 2017, following
         | the Governmental crisis in Finland in 2017. Namely, the party was
         | member of governing coalition in Finland. In 2017, after Jussi
         | Halla-aho was elected as the Finns Party president, other
         | coalition members (Center Party and National Coalition Party)
         | declared that they did not want to continue cooperation with the
         | Finns Party. As a result, the Finns Party went into opposition.
         | However, 20 MPs abandoned the Finns Party and formed a new
         | parliamentary group, which continued to support the governing
         | coalition and hold ministers in Finland's government. This group
         | became a new political party in Finland - Blue Reform (numerical
         | code 246009).

         |
         | When respondents named a party who they voted for in the open
         | ended vote choice question, the respondents' answers didn't 
         | always tally with the party's most recent name. Hence, for 
         | smaller parties, there may be some slight deviations in the
         | party's names. 
         |
         | PARTY A (Ordinary people - Independent personalities) formed
         | a joint list with New Majority (NOVA), Christian Union (KU) and
         | Change from Below (DU) for the 2020 parliamentary election.
         |
         | LEADER B (Peter Pellegrini) was the leader of SMER-Social
         | Democracy (PARTY B) at the time of the 2020 election. Therefore, 
         | E5000_L_B (LEADER B IDENTIFIER - NUMERICAL) specifies Pellegrini 
         | to be a member of SMER. However, Pellegrini left the party after
         | the election and formed a new party "Voice - Social Democracy",
         | assigned numeric party code 703205.
         |
         | PARTY E (Progressive Slovakia - TOGETHER-Civic Democracy) was an
         | electoral coalition consisting of Progressive Slovakia (PS) and
         | TOGETHER - Civic Democracy (SPOLU) for the 2020 election.
         |
         | LEADER E (Michal Truban) is a Slovak politician, entrepreneur,
         | investor and founder of several startups, who is a former
         | chairman of the Progressive Slovakia political party and leader
         | of Progressive Slovakia - SPOLU coalition for the 2020 election.
         |
         | LEADER H (Robert Fico) is a former Prime Minister of Slovakia.
         | He is from SMER-Social Democracy and was the first leader
         | of that political party, since 1999.
         |
         | 703015. Also known as the Slovak Peoples Party of Andrej
         | Hlinka (SLS). 
         |
         | 703023. Movement for Democratic Slovakia - this party was
         | dissolved in 2014.
         |
         | 703025. Voice - Social Democracy was founded in June 2020
         | by a group of former members of SMER (PARTY B) headed by the 
         | former leader of SMER, Peter Pellegrini (LEADER B).
         | As the party was founded only after the election, it was not an 
         | option on the ballot for the 2020 election. Consequently, code
         | 703025 is only used in variables E3010_2 and E3024_3 to identify 
         | respondents who felt represented by Voice - Social Democracy best

         | The alphabetical codes for political parties were assigned in
         | descending order of the vote share for district candidates in 
         | the 2016 Legislative Election.
         | For elections to its unicameral legislature, the National 
         | Assembly, South Korea employs a mixed electoral system in which
         | respondents cast one vote for district candidates in single-
         | member constituencies (SMD), and a second vote for closed party 
         | lists (proportional representation). 
         | Alphabetic party codes were assigned according to district 
         | candidate votes because the vast majority of seats (253 out of
         | 300) are returned by district candidate vote. Additionally, 
         | seats of both segments are allocated separately; each party is 
         | allocated its proportionate share of the PR seats plus the SMD 
         | seats won by its candidates. 
         |
         | LEADER B (Jong-in Kim) was chairman of the Democratic Party at
         | the time of the 2016 legislative election. He was the successor
         | of LEADER I (Jae-in Moon), who led the party until January 2016.

         |
         | LEADER A (Guy Parmelin), LEADER B (Alain Berset), LEADER C
         | (Karin-Keller Sutter), and LEADER E (Viola Amherd) are Federal
         | Councilors from the four parties represented in the outgoing
         | federal government. The Federal Councilors are members and
         | ministers of the government, but they are not party leaders.
         | Swiss collaborators asked the question about Federal Councilors
         | rather than party leaders because citizens know Federal
         | Councilors much better than party leaders - a lot of citizens
         | do not even know the party leaders. Additionally, the Swiss
         | Election Study has always asked about the Federal Councilors and
         | not party leaders, which allows for comparisons over time.
         |
         | LEADER D (Regula Rytz) is the party leader of the Green Party.
         |
         | In two cantons (Tessin and Geneva), respondents were
         | additionally asked about regional parties (Lega and MCG) that
         | exist and play an important role in the respective canton
         | only. Thus, these parties are assigned alphabetical codes
         | PARTY H (Lega) and PARTY I (MCG).

))) PARTY IDENTIFIERS FROM OTHER COMPARATIVE STUDIES 
===========================================================================

For all parties that are assigned an alphabetical code in the CSES dataset,
CSES provides party identifiers from two other comparative projects, 
namely the Manifesto Research on Political Representation (MARPOR, 
formerly the Comparative Manifesto Project, CMP) project, and The 
Parliament and Government (ParlGov) database. Below, we list the 
identifiers assigned by each project to a party included in CSES Module 5.
Inclusion of these identifiers allow for easy data bridging between
CSES Module 5 and these datasets.

Data are only listed for polities where information is available. Polities 
are listed in alphabetical order. Parties are listed in order of their A-I 
assignment in each polity. In circumstances where there are multiple 
elections that are included in Module 5 for one polity, parties are first 
listed according to alphabetical assignment for the first election 
study in question.

         |
         | Dialogue for Hungary and "Together" formed an electoral alliance
         | in the previous 2014 legislative election. CMP/MARPOR does not
         | award a separate code for "Together" for the 2018 election, but
         | continues using the alliance code 86340, reported in the table
         | above. As the vote share reported by CMP/MARPOR (0.66%) matches  
         | the election result for "Together" in 2018, CSES assumes that
         | data reported under code 86340 refer to "Together" in 2018 rather
         | than the alliance.
